       "'My super conservative Southern Baptist MIL is hella mad at me for getting vaccinated for a few reasons:\\n\\n1. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall haven‚Äôt even begun to have children, who knows what it‚Äôs doing to your dna?‚Äù Her point was that vaccines cause autism therefore our future children could be autistic since I‚Äôve been vaccinated. As an autistic person with several autistic family members, I had to be the one to break it to her that if our kids are autistic, it‚Äôs because there is a genetic predisposition to autism on my side of the family, not because I got vaxxed. \\n\\n2. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt trust what the government says.‚Äù Fair, I don‚Äôt either, which is why I am listening to scientists. \\n\\n3. ‚ÄúYour FIL‚Äôs cousin Mark is a doctor and he said he‚Äôs not gonna get the vaccine because he‚Äôs not done having kids and he said the other doctors he works with aren‚Äôt gonna get vaccinated either.‚Äù Okay but why would I listen to Mark - a doctor in buttfuck nowhere Alabama - and his coworkers - also doctors in buttfuck nowhere Alabama - over the hundreds of thousands of doctors that ARE comfortable with the vaccine or any of the doctors that have made this shit their life‚Äôs work? \\n\\n\\nShe‚Äôs been giving me the silent treatment for the last three weeks after I told her I‚Äôd rather get vaccinated and have a living breathing autistic child than get covid and miscarry or die during childbirth. I got my second shot today and feel great üòö. Had a nurse claim the vaccine wasn‚Äôt real and she wouldn‚Äôt take it while not wearing a mask next to a child with extreme respiratory, immune system and learning disabilities. NHS need to crack down on people like this serving as a bad image for them.. Not an interaction with an antivaxxer, but just wanted to share some good news (which may lead to many future interactions with antivaxxers or vaccine hesitant folks). \\n\\nI *finally* finished EPIC, my vaccine course!! I feel pretty competent in discussing vaccines now, but I‚Äôm a bit nervous about actually poking the babies this coming week for the practical portion of my learning. But new things will make anyone nervous, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get used to doing it soon! Plus I get to help at the mass COVID immunization clinic starting next week :). My grandfather is a Trump-supporting conspiracy theorist. So is his oldest son, my uncle. Both of them are not getting their COVID vaccines because they think they‚Äôll be microchipped or whatever other bullshit they read off of Facebook (or Parler, maybe), even though they‚Äôre both eligible and 1)they‚Äôre both at-risk and 2)a LOT of my family are high-risk, including a cousin with cystic fibrosis who CANNOT get sick whatsoever. My anti vaxx, anti mask aunt keeps posting on our family chat misinformation about the Covid vaccines and it‚Äôs driving me bonkers. She posted today a link from VAERS saying that something like 5000 people have gone to the ER after getting the shot, and 900 have died. \\n\\nThere are so many things wrong with this, I can‚Äôt even begin. VAERS allows anyone to report, which means there could be false reports. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt have any way to show cause. Like, if someone goes to the ER for an unrelated illness after getting the shot and then reports it, that is included in the count!\\n\\nAnd even if those numbers are accurate, what about the hundreds of thousands of covid deaths and even more who have been affected by the actual illness? Oh wait, I forgot, those numbers are faked /s.\\n\\nI know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir, I just need to vent a bit.. There is this guy called Alex Berenson going on on Twitter about how the covid vaccines haven‚Äôt been tested enough and his followers are commenting about how the big pharma and government is lying to us and quite honestly, this is what I‚Äôm scared of.. About what might be hidden from us... My one-time girlfriend and current friend had a psychiatric emergency, was hospitalized for a few months, and was released recently. She\\'s been skeptical of getting the vaccine due to \"side effects\" and having a \"sensitive body\", and I don\\'t know what that means. She\\'s also recently joined some kind of antivaxx Evangelical church after previously affiliating with mainstream Christianity. I don\\'t exactly know what to do here. If I had just met her on the street today I probably wouldn\\'t talk to her at all. But I admit that due to my own psychiatric issues at the time, I was not the best boyfriend (not that that excuses it) when we were dating. And due to what she\\'s been through, I feel obligated to stick by her as a friend.. I kinda stopped my mom from becoming one cause I caught it in time. \\nRight after she started trying chiropractic adjustments she asked me to go with her. The moment I walked into this place my stomach went south as she went into the back I began to look around the place and it got worse. Pamphlets saying it could reverse autism and asthma to one saying it could cure cancer.\\n\\nAfter she came out I rushed her out the door and immediately told her to never come back.\\nShe asked why and I told her the truth \"these people are quacks\" and she said they had a doctor in the building...funny thing. No they didn\\'t. They had no license or diploma on display. They literally told my mom that they were doctors!\\n\\nSo after this I showed her the facts about it and she asked her doctor who confirmed. But during that lunch as I was going off I mentioned that their claims were as stupid as saying vaccines cause autism. Mom said \"well....\" and I shut it down because I know that she KNOWS better than this being a former preschool teacher! I asked where she got the info and \"your aunt on Facebook\" and I groaned told her that my aunt was full of shit and next time she tells you stuff ask for proof.\\n\\nShe also apparently thought that it was government controlled which was pretty easy to shut down. Since ya know. Even in a pandemic they can\\'t work together. Its the scientists that gave us the current vaccines not the governments.\\n\\nMy stepdad is a conspiracy nut and yes a trumper. Hes a lost cause. All I can do is counter the bullshit with fact. This is a general antivaxx thing, I know most of the shit recently is covid, but when I worked in the ER(EMT) we had this kid who I think had chickenpox. Turns out neither he nor his parents were vaccinated so it caused a big fuss in the ER. Kid wasn\\'t doing well at their home with their honestly BS remedies so they took him to the ER, as they should. We had them and everyone near them wear an amount of PPE that was generally between gloves and a mask and hazmat level shit. They were skeptical about the work we could pull off but low and behold, kid saw immediate improvement and went on to recover. They were very pleased and listened to what we had to say from like 8 different people working in the ER. They seemed very receptive and I heard through the grapevine there that they got their whole family vaccinated in a different wing of the same hospital not long after \\n\\nMore recently, friend of a friend was skeptical about the covid vaccine for him and his mother....Mother is on her 80s and somehow runs an in person dance studio... said he was scared she would die from the vaccine and I explained to him 2 million people have died from covid and more Americans have died from covid than wwii. And he repeated himself and I\\'m just like dude, she will die from covid. Get her vaccinated.. The newest thing is my sister in law calling the Covid Vaccine \"not a real vaccine\". She legitimately believes herd immunity is the only path forward and doesn\\'t acknowledge the death toll that\\'s accrued because we didn\\'t have a vaccine.\\n\\nIt\\'s so frustrating.. All my cousins are adults, and one of them is anti-vaxx. She also self diagnosed a gluten allergy. Overall a complete idiot.. 500+ people have died from covid 19 vax. Look at cdc website and VAERS. How is this save?. I‚Äôm not sure if this was an antivaxxer or just a shockingly ignorant healthcare worker. I was getting a vitamin shot the other day and asked the medical person... whatever rank you have to be to give shots...whether the clinic was qualified for the first responder Covid vaccines. She said no, but then told me about her sister getting one of the mRNA shots and getting actual Covid right after. She (the woman giving me the shot) said that she thought the vaccine could have caused Covid.  I had to pull the PhD virology card to tell her no way, no how. But it was sad that she didn‚Äôt know that.. Does a unvaccinated person carry a higher viral load? If so, does that higher viral load have the potential to make vaccinated people MORE ill, than if they contracted covid from someone who HAD been vaccinated? I hope this makes sense.. My parents are anti-vax Trumpers. They attend a pentecostal church which is typically a hotbed for anti-vax conspiratorial stuff.\\n\\nI discovered a surprising pro-vax stance FB post, by that particular church organization\\'s superintendent that is held in high regard by many. I thought about sharing it with them.\\n\\nI\\'ll come back with an update if I do.. Got my second dose of Pfizer about 14 hours ago. Went to bed fine...woke up at midnight wracked with tremors and feeling like garbage. Gross.. Got my second Pfizer shot in TX, USA last week! Other than a sore arm, I felt completely normal. No fatigue even. Same for my boyfriend and mother. My younger brither felt super ill, but he felt super ill after the first shot as well. I think we all felt more ill after the first shot than second.. Just had my first dose of the AstraZeneca. Very nervous as my entire family got ill after their first dose and I struggle a lot with health anxiety. Especially worried as I\\'m severely emetophobic and one of the listed side effects is vomiting. Still happy to be getting it though, my life has been on hold for the last year as I live with a clinically extremely vulnerable person.\\n\\nEDIT: 1 day on and I feel like trash. Barely slept due to having a 39/102 degree fever. Body aches all over and painkillers seem to barely touch it at all. Still not regretting it, even though I feel awful. If this is what it feels like to get Covid, I\\'d rather not risk it.. I wish, but in Europe we don\\'t have enough vaccine for everyone now... I wish, my country is in the middle of a political crysis regarding the vaccines and who knows when the rest of us that aren\\'t healthworkers are going to be vaccinated. Basically there was a double blind study with Sinopharm last year but there were extra doses that were supposed to be administrated to the volunteers and healthcare workers that ended up being received by politicians while people were dropping like flies because of lack of UCI beds, oxygen and healthworkers (because they were sick and dying).  It\\'s a HUGE mess and the vaccine credibility and our credibility as a country has tanked. Look at \"Vacunagate Peru\". I want to get vaccinated but seems we\\'ll have to wait until April at the very least and that\\'s being generous.. This isn‚Äôt meant to make anyone wary, or concerned as I am very pro fax myself. I got my second dose of moderna at 11:15 am, it‚Äôs currently 5:00 am and I have g been able to sleep between vomiting, nausea, body chills, fever, and a horrible migraine. Does anyone have any advice please, I really need to sleep.. I got my second Pfizer dose last week and am so thankful to have gotten it. I had a fever for a day or so and was fatigued for a few days. Definitely worth it for having substantial immunity against the virus.. Fully vaxxed with Moderna! I was lucky and didn‚Äôt have symptoms with either dose. I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine a couple of days ago.   I was a little wary of it since everyone in my family reported flu like symptoms after getting their second dose, but so far it seems I dodged that bullet. I do feel a little more tired than usual, though.\\n\\nThe guy who gave me the shot teased me a little bit by asking me to go outside and ask for a sticker. Honestly I was a little bummed when I realized there wasn\\'t one.. Heading out to get my second Moderna dose in an hour. Only symptoms I had after my first shot was general body aches, awful pain at the injection site, and a little swelling and redness at the injection site. I am, admittedly, a baby when it comes to pain. I\\'ll update this post with my symptoms as they develop!\\n\\nEdit 1: Hello, I feel Awful. I woke up this morning with a fever of 101.6 and barely able to move. I took a fever reducer and it went down a little, and my arm is slowly beginning to fell less sore. Could just be the pain medication, though.. Got moderna today!!. Can I use an icy hot patch on the injection site for pain/soreness? Any risk of interfering with the vaccine?. I got the Astra Zeneca vaccine earlier and I feel slightly rubbish and sick but at least I know it‚Äôs working lol.. How do you know it will have a positive effect on you? I\\'m not an antivaxxer, and I get vaccinated from the flu every time I need it. This vaccine literally took what, a year to make? While the flu one took way more to develop. Or is the current medicine much more advanced? \\n\\nMy friend got covid vaccine and immediately fell unconscious, we chatted through video while he was in hospital and AFAIK, he\\'s healthy like it should be, but didn\\'t handle the vaccine. \\n\\nThe virus is also mutating and fast. Won\\'t that make the vaccines obsolete? \\n\\nAnd since it\\'s a new vaccine and definitely not examined on what results it can give to the patient in the future, how can I be assured that I won\\'t get cancer in few years? Or whatever abnormalities it can develop.. Got the first shot of Moderna yesterday afternoon. Felt fine, a little arm pain but nothing too bad. Woke up and the arm pain was a lot better. Went drifting in my friends car and now I can‚Äôt tell if my headache is vaccine or dizziness. 5 days in on 2nd pfizer shot and no side effects but the injection site discomfort, which was actually worse on the first shot.  Piece of cake.  \\n\\nNow when will we get some research on whether it is effective in preventing vaccinated individuals from being carriers?  I want my life back.. Got my second dose of Pfizer/Biontech on 2/6.  Here\\'s my experience: \\n\\n* First dose: zero side effects, less site pain than the flu shot\\n* Second dose:\\n   * Shot received at 7:30 AM 2/6\\n   * Site pain was **much** worse on this one...like being punched in the arm by a pro boxer (site pain was worst on day 1, less day 2, and minimal by day 3, gone by day 4)\\n   * Felt fine at noon, went for an 8-mile run\\n   * Continued to feel fine all day and figured I was out of the woods as most who develop side effects typically present within 8-10 hours\\n   * 2 AM Sunday woke up with chills and body aches but no fever...took Ibuprofen at 3 AM\\n   * Couldn\\'t get back to sleep until almost 5 AM and wound up with a 1% WHOOP (biometric tracker) recovery score...i.e. zero recovery or rest.\\n   * Sunday: spent the entire day between the couch and bed with heavy fatigue and moderate body aches but none of the other symptoms that typically go with this disease (sinus, lung, neurological, etc)\\n   * In bed by 9 PM Sunday\\n   * Slept like a rock and woke up at 7 AM Monday and I\\'m not sure I moved all night (86% recovery)\\n   * Mild fatigue persisted in the early part of the day but resolved by noon\\n   * Felt fine by mid-day Monday, 2/8\\n   * By Tuesday, I was back to 100%\\n\\nTwo weeks out I\\'m now (according to the data) fully immunized and, other than a strong urge to buy nothing but Microsoft products ( üòâ ) I have absolutely zero side effects.    \\n\\n\\nGood luck to the rest of you still waiting; I hope you\\'re able to get yours soon and, when you do, plan to take the following day, and possibly the day after that, off.. I really want the vaccine but I really want a baby soon. Is the infertility side effect bullshit? Lol I know you\\'re going to say it is but I\\'m still anxious.. If I get the vaccine will it stop the spread of the virus?. I‚Äôm getting my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine today after work and am a little nervous. My first reaction seemed to just be a tiny bit of arm soreness for a couple of day‚Äôs, and fatigue that seemed to last a couple of days but wasn‚Äôt dehabilitating. I just started this new job and it‚Äôs in my dream field, how worried should I be that this next dose will affect me heavily and maybe take me away from work? Is there anything I should do to prep to mitigate the effects? Tylenol for soreness before/after? Ice before/after!\\n\\nThanks! And happy injecting. Question , I got the moderna dose 1 .  The night before and the week leading up to it, I was taking baby aspirin . And the night before I believe I took one Tylenol. Noting on the day and the vaccination was some 19 hours later from the last time I took anything. \\n\\nAfter the vaccine (got it Saturday) my arm was very sore, any time I touch the arm or stretch or do anything, it hurts. Was like that on Sunday as well. But Sunday I was just in bed for the most part, didn‚Äôt feel like doing anything or even had much of an appetite until the late at night.  Today is day 3, the arm isn‚Äôt as sore , and I had a slight headache when I woke up. \\n\\nMy question is, am I okay that I took some otc medication before the vaccination?. Got my second dose of the Moderna vaccine today! I got my first dose a month ago and it knocked me out for a few days. Oh well. Maybe this second booster shot won‚Äôt make me feel like I have the flu this time if I felt sick the first time. \\n\\nDespite the illnesses, I‚Äôm so happy to have gotten vaccinated. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this soon (I have Cystic Fibrosis, a heart condition, am immunocompromised due to years and years of harsh medicines, and a few other things, which means I had a 50/50 chance of ending up on a ventilator even though I‚Äôm young and appear healthy), but I‚Äôm so glad I got it done. \\n\\nSeriously, y‚Äôall. Get vaccinated! It‚Äôs our only way through this.. I\\'m about to get my 2nd dose next week. Pretty much everyone I know have gotten their 1st or 2nd. Looking forward to gaining some sense of normality soon ü§û. I\\'m so excited and have to share with people who will get it. Really get it. \\n\\nI\\'m a nursing student on placement and yesterday I got to mix up a vial of the Pfizer vaccine and then administer five of the six doses. I\\'ve only ever done an intramuscular injection once before (a flu vaccine in October last year) and due to covid we haven\\'t had in person practical classes. \\n\\nBut will the help of my supervisor, I mixed up the vaccine and stabbed a bunch of willing participants. \\n\\nAnd next week I will get my own first dose. I\\'m beyond excited to be able to contribute positively to this pandemic. (And grateful that I\\'ve yet to meet an openly anti vaxx nurse on my placements thus far). As someone that had covid and is surrounded by idiots saying for one reason or another that they\\'re not going to. This thread is a godsend and a hope for humanity.\\n\\nIt is hell. Far worse than what they just tell you on the news. I couldn\\'t breathe, walk or eat. I sustained myself on bananas and orange juice. The coughing was truly insane. I was in extreme pain. And now that I\\'m recovered I\\'ve discovered that it now hurts to breathe at times. Apparently an after effect is scaring in your lungs\\n\\nSo to those looking at this wondering if its really bad enough before getting the vaccine listen carefully\\n\\nGET THE VACCINE!!! I HAVE TO WAIT TWO MONTHS!\\n\\nI WOULD ONLY WISH THIS ON MY WORST ENEMY!. Vnn. Sorry to say it but I was gona get the vaccine but now that its not gona protect me from the virus at all still have wear mask all that crap what\\'s point in getting this experimental vaccine if it dosent protect me or anyone else like ? \\nI\\'m not anti at all but now I have looked into it an all the people who have had bad reaction to it and not to mention all the deaths that they are trying to say was there underlying conditions I dont belive it. \\n\\nTo manny notable doctors speaking out against it. I rather fight it with natural immunity. Yes I already had it and my two elderly grandparents 82 and 87 both copd and asthmatics they didnt even know they had it and had no symptoms either but know ppl who have died also so hit and miss but they will not get it for they life left in them there old school I guess lol it\\'s there choice at end of day as is mine and yourse. \\n\\nHope. Got my first dose of Pfizer a couple of hours ago. My arm is a little achey and I want to take a nap. The latter isn\\'t out of the ordinary for me lol.. Got the second dose of the Pfizer on Saturday and I‚Äôm still dealing with the massive migraine it gave me. I‚Äôm a chronic migraine sufferer, so just a heads up if you are too. It sucks, but it‚Äôs definitely preferable to covid!. Got my 2nd pfizer shot 2 days ago I just have arm soreness and I sneezed a lot yesterday lol I had less arm soreness than my 1st shot. On the other hand my sister got fatigued after both of her shots and some lightheadedness. Got my second Moderna vaccination earlier today...and no anxiety attack this time!\\n\\nFelt pretty exhausted (which could very likely be from an extremely busy day at work), arm hurts, and I have a slight headache again. Like most others, I‚Äôm expecting more side effects in the next day. I‚Äôll update sometime tomorrow!\\n\\nEdit: Approximately 24 hours later, and my temp is slowly going up (but not quite at a fever level). My head feels fuzzy and I‚Äôve got muscle aches. This is why I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not working.\\n\\nEdit again: Ended up with a low grade fever, which was swiftly taken care of with some ibuprofen. Also had cramping (like period cramps) and fatigue. I was back to normal about 40 hours post vaccine. My coworkers had similar symptoms, so best advice is to take the next day off, and make sure you have analgesics/antipyretics handy.. I had my first jab of the Oxford AstraZeneca on Wednesday. Felt a bit rough yesterday, achey and tired but otherwise fine today. My arm is sore but that\\'s it!. I got the first Pfizer dose on Jan 23 and I still have moments of pain in my arm where I got the shot. I noticed it quite a bit last night, it felt like I just got it. Is it normal to still feel sore a couple of weeks after?. I got my second jab of Moderna yesterday. I am very achey, exhausted, and having GI problems. Obviously totally worth it, though! My coworker friend got it on Sunday, missed work Monday, and was back today with a spring in her step.. Got the pfizer vaccine a week ago today and have zero side effects other than soreness typical of every arm muscle injection I ever got.. I took the Pfizer vaccine on Friday around 10am. The vaccine felt fine, they said it would burn but I didn‚Äôt feel anything. Went back to work and was fine for the remainder of the day.\\n\\nWoke up Saturday and felt cold but just figured it was chilly outside. Got ready for work - felt tired but figured it was just early. About 2 hours into work - it just hit me like a truck. I was freezing even though it was 60 degrees out, I felt so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. My head was warm, and I felt nauseous. Around 7am, my head felt like it was going to explode. I‚Äôve never had a headache give such a blinding, debiltiating pain in my life. I was sent home and tried to sleep it off. I was in and out all day... my hips were so sore it was hard to get comfortable. I woke up around 6pm, tried to drink some water, had no appetite and fell back to sleep until 7am this morning. All together I slept for almost 20 hours!\\n\\nI feel much better today. I had covid back in July and the only symptoms I really had was loss of taste/smell and for 1 day I felt like I had a head cold.\\n\\nHoping the 2nd vaccine isn‚Äôt so bad!. Got mine Friday. Saturday night I felt weak and tired. All of my symptoms except for a sore arm were so mild that I cannot say if it even was the jab. I have low blood pressure and when it drops, I feel weak. The tiredness may have been from how active I was Saturday as it was a busy day. I took a nap and felt better afterwards. Full disclosure, I had a lot of alcohol on saturday, so all of my symptoms may have been self induced. \\nNow for the second dose, who experienced vomitting? I am a massive emeticphobe, I need someone to tell me they didn\\'t vomit and not to worry. :). I just got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today! The shot itself barely felt like anything. Thank you to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation for making this possible! [Celebratory selfie!](http://Vaccinated! https://imgur.com/a/XMwG8yL)\\n\\nIt\\'s been a little over 13 hours and main symptoms are: arm pain, fatigue, maybe a little headache and nausea. Will edit this comment periodically with updates.\\n\\nUpdate: after 24 hours, my arm is still sore but not as much. That\\'s all.. What side effects are there after the second shot ( if there are any )?. Got my second dose of Moderna yesterday and am SO worried I\\'ll feel sick like a lot of the people I\\'ve heard from about it\\n\\nETA: I felt like poop for about 12 hours, starting at 18 hours after vaccination but WAY better than having Covid!. I got the Pfizer vaccine yesterday about 16 hours ago, so far my arm is just sore as it would be with a TDAP but not nearly as bad as the HPV vaccine was.. Got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday (it\\'s been 25 hours approximately). Side effects are just arm soreness and some fatigue.. Got my first Moderna shot 90 minutes ago this morning. Was very frightened because I have a history of anaphylaxis. So far so good knock on wood. \\n\\nNow I have to see how I feel over the next few days.. Got the Moderna vaccine today. I have high anxiety over taking any medication. I had a huge panic attack a few hours after taking the shot. IDK if my mental health can take the second shot.. Got the first dose of Moderna yesterday! Potentially concerned since I got my flu shot within the last two weeks (didn\\'t realize I\\'d be eligible for the vaccine so soon or I would have waited on the flu shot). The nurses told me there haven\\'t been many studies on any interactions yet, so hopefully I do alright. \\n\\nYesterday I had some brief chest tightness/coldness that came up a couple times throughout the day but was fleeting. Nausea was the main thing otherwise. Today, not nauseous but lethargic with some lower abdominal mild discomfort, and super soreness in my arm.. ***First of all, I\\'m not an anti-vaxxer so don\\'t be hostile towards my concerns. I came here looking to be educated. So if you\\'re currently preparing a witty response to my concerns please excuse yourself from this thread.***\\n\\nMy two concerns are:\\n\\n1. I can\\'t help but feel a little suspicious about the fact that 4 or 5 manufacturers/producers/labs announced the completion of their new vaccine all within a span of a month or so. Given that each product operates using a unique method, I find it a little strange that they all became available at relatively the same time. I\\'m not necessarily claiming that there must have been some conspiracy or fowl-play involved here, but I would certainly appreciate if anyone could explain the coincidental logistics of how that happened.\\n2. I\\'m more than happy to drop point number 1 if these vaccine weren\\'t so rushed. Now I understand that this pandemic ushered in an incredible global effort to develop this vaccine as soon as possible, but I distinctly remember last February when health ministers around the world said that this vaccine would take at least 18-24 months to develop. I hardly ever fall for conspiracies but given what this pandemic has done to the global economies, governments obviously have an immense incentive to push out a vaccine as quickly as possible. And as far as I can tell, there\\'s no way of truly knowing whether or not any steps were skipped during the development of this vaccine.\\n\\nI live in Dubai, UAE and the Sinopharm (China) and Pfizer-BioNTech (US) vaccines are becoming almost readily available for the general public. Furthermore, many companies are pushing for their employees to take the vaccine (obviously to limit any further paid sick leaves). I\\'m not completely shutting down the possibility of taking the vaccine but I would definitely like these points addressed before I take it.\\n\\nLooking forward to your responses!\\n\\nEDIT: It also doesn\\'t help that the Sinopharm chairman and another director resigned last week for \"personal reasons.\". I got the second moderna shot...\\n\\nNo side effects on the first shot..\\n\\nI‚Äôm pretty sick after the second shot...\\n\\nI have flu like symptoms.. The Bill Gates 5G Illuminati Microchip Mind Control  vaccine isn\\'t available here yet for the general public, so I\\'m still waiting.\\n\\nMy mom was able to get it though. No signs of autism, but side effects included her cussing at the NFL game. Must be a nanomachine malfunction üôÉ\\n\\n*The fact some people believe in that nonsense is absolutely baffling to me.*. I received my Covid vaccine, I work at a healthcare facility.  I noticed that administrators/higher ups brought in family members to get vaccinated (people that do not work at the facility). Something about the fact that these folks might‚Äôve cut in line bothers me, does anyone know of anything like this happening? Is there anything that can be done? I‚Äôm all about getting more people vaccinated- but the situation with these family members seemed wrong to me. Hoping for some advice.. I got my first shot yesterday. I‚Äôm a 21 year old, semi-healthy male. No critical conditions or diseases or anything like that, just your basic overweight problems (which I‚Äôm making great progress on). I got the moderna vaccine and I take the second shot in a few weeks. Should I expect anything? I don‚Äôt have bad reactions or allergies to vaccines ever.. I got the first vaccine a week ago and I‚Äôm feeling fine now. When I got the vaccine I felt like I had flu like symptoms (still way better than actually getting Covid). I know this because I had covid a few months ago. I thought by now my antibodies would be gone, but I experienced a lot more symptoms than my co-workers who got the vaccine (they have not had covid in the past). Is it possible that I still have antibodies and that is what cause the side effects?. I got the moderna shot 2 weeks ago. My arm was sore for about 3 days (felt like normal post workout pain in my deltoid - not anything to write home about). I usually get chills/body aches after the flu shot but I didn\\'t have anything besides the sore arm with the moderna shot.\\n\\nMy roommate and another friend got the moderna shot last week. They both had chills, fatigue, body aches the day after. Started a few hours after getting the shot and lasted til about noon the next day. No diarrhea, no vomiting. My roommate was slightly nauseous but he said that went away pretty quick. \\n\\nI\\'ve asked a lot of people that have gotten it and it seems like side effects are relatively uncommon (like 1/5) and never anything worse than a *mild* cold. \\n\\nMy roommate and our mutual friend are both excited to get the second shot, in spite of the annoying side effects.. I just got my second dose today!!. *UPDATE - I survived. Last night was rough, but this morning I was fine (other than being exhausted from lack of sleep and a sore arm from the injection site). My supervisor had the opposite experience; she was fine all day yesterday but had to go home within two hours of being at work due to fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Our program director experienced these side effects after her first dose, but nothing after her second. My advice: try to schedule the shots on days when you are able to rest afterward and the following day; it seems like side effects vary but it would be safer to give yourself some time to recuperate :)\\n\\nSocial worker here, very grateful to have the opportunity to get vaccinated as I have been continuously working in the community since the spread of COVID.\\n\\nI just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). \\n\\nAt around 7pm this evening, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps (oddly similar to period cramps) and a low grade fever (99.1 temp). I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience so far, or if they had to miss work from side effects of the second dose? I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll be able to sleep it off and be back to normal 8 hours from now when I leave for work. \\n\\nOther than that, haven‚Äôt grown any extra limbs and my microchip seems to have settled in nicely.. I\\'m 16. I\\'ve kept up tith the news, checked out OOTL every now and then for stuff I missed. (Reddit is basically my main source of news) but I woke up this morninging and in the back of my mind I just had... I wouldn\\'t call it a fear, but its one of those \"what ifs\"\\nLike, I just woke up and thought about it. \"What if this doesn\\'t work\" and \"what if it never clears up\" which snowballed into \"I hear its mutating\" and \"were in more danger every day\" I spent some time in awww and eye bleach to calm down but the thought hasn\\'t left me throughout the day. \\n\\n\"What if this doesn\\'t work\". Medical Assistant - I received my vaccine last night, I feel so lucky! But I have had a few bad side effects. The normal ones like headache, chills and nausea‚Ä¶ But what I‚Äôm finding really worrying is my psychiatric side effects? I can‚Äôt find any of this recorded anywhere so maybe I‚Äôm the only one, but I woke up this morning completely not myself, so incredibly aggressive and anxious. I wasn‚Äôt worried about getting the vaccine at all and expected the normal side effects... but tomorrow is my first day at a new site and I am freaking out because I can‚Äôt concentrate and I‚Äôm worried I might blow up on someone? I‚Äôm also the kind of person who can‚Äôt even take things like NyQuil because I develop moderate psychosis‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôm wondering if this has anything to do with it? I still advocate for the vaccine 100% and I‚Äôm so proud of anyone who gets it, but my main question is has anyone else experienced anything weird like this?\\n\\nUpdate: I was only sick the night I got the vaccine, and the worst part (the weird mental stuff especially) was thankfully just the next day. I was a little run down for a few more days, but just to follow up I‚Äôm absolutely fine :). I just received my first shot yesterday morning! (Moderna). I‚Äôve had soreness from vaccines before but this is the most ‚Äúpain‚Äù I‚Äôve had from an injection. Tolerable- I just can‚Äôt put on deodorant. I‚Äôm so excited for my second one.. I\\'m a psychologist, working with patients with physical health problems, Ireceived my vaccine yesterday (Pfizer). Very glad to have it. \\n\\nI have had a mild fever and flu like aches but this is good... This means it\\'s working!  All worth it to protect against the possible impact of Covid.. I‚Äôm getting in closer to springtime but I‚Äôm so afraid of needles. That‚Äôs my only concern. I got my first Pfizer vaccine this morning. I have major shot anxiety (I pass out sometimes) but I did it, no passing out! I feel like I am living history and making a difference. Now round 2 is in 3 weeks and This is the first time I have been excited to get a shot.. Vax happened for me a few hours ago. Arm feels like I got a tetanus shot but so far not bad at all. And my hospital gave us little charms to put on our badge reels for staff to show that we‚Äôre vaccinated. Tldr: how do we know that the vaccine is safe in the long run if it\\'s taken less than a year to develop?\\n\\nMy family aren\\'t exactly anti-vaxx but they have become very sceptical of vaccines even though we were all vaccinated as children.\\n\\nMy dad, being in his 60s, received a letter from the NHS asking him to apply to get the vaccine. He\\'s asked his friends and the rest of my family if he should get it, they all said no. He asked me and I said yes - he trusts my opinion and is going to get it.\\n\\nEven though I\\'ll always tell anyone to get it and I\\'ll definitely get it myself as soon as I\\'m able to, a part of me is worried about how quickly these vaccines were developed. I keep thinking about the thalidomide crisis. How do we know about long term effects?. How long does it take, and what does it feel like? I remember the HPV vaccine kind of burned.\\n\\nI have a severe phobia of needles, especially when they have to stay put for too long. I know there\\'s videos of people having it done, but uh... I can\\'t watch them.\\n\\nObviously I\\'ll be getting it done either way, I just want to brace myself I guess? The last couple of regular flu shots I\\'ve had, I\\'m always pleasantly surprised by how quick it is.. I got my first shot today (Pfizer). I am a doctor and work in long term care homes so I was higher on the priority lists where I live and work. Other than soreness in the arm, no side effects. Feeling very relieved and hopeful.. I got my first Moderna vaccination today! After everyone at the long term care home got vaccinated, they had some leftover doses. The next in line was the COVID testing crew (myself, my manager, one of the Public Health nurses, and the two clinic admins), the two permanent physicians, and the NP student.\\n\\nWent through the questionnaire, got the immunization from my nurse educator, and then got to wait with everyone in another room to monitor for reactions. About 10 minutes after the immunization, I had a bit of an anxiety attack (thankfully the NP student was there to assess and reassure me that it was not anaphylaxis). Thankfully, it passed quickly and I continued on with my work day. Probably got worked up because the last thing I was learning in my vaccination module was anaphylaxis üòÖ\\n\\nI definitely feel the soreness in my arm, along with some fatigue (which might just be from work), and the mildest of headaches. Definitely beats having COVID!. Howdy, I got my moderna shot on Wednesday. My arm was a little sore and I was tired on Thursday. My infant didn‚Äôt sleep well on Thursday night; that coupled with some, arguably, side effects have made me a bit lethargic today. Nothing horrible at all. Hopefully, I‚Äôll be 100% tomorrow.. My dad\\'s parents are in line to be vaccinated. Once they are and have some time for antibodies to form, can they spread it still? I can\\'t get it right now because I\\'m pregnant. Do we both need to be vaccinated or can we actually hug our family again?. Hello!! I\\'m getting an appointment to get the covid vaccine because, duh, but like some relatives and friends are on my butt saying shit like they heard it has long term side affects or some crap like that and I already have anxiety so.. it\\'s been tough. \\n\\nDid any of you get it? I just need some encouragement for this. I answered someone above but I have always had extreme anxiety with needles. I have gotten better over time with therapy and general anxiety treatment. However I still hate them and still have anxiety. Now I am a therapist and I help others with similar issues! It was the quickest and least painful shot I‚Äôve had in memory. The nurse giving it to me let me talk about my horse which really helped üòäOnly side effect is my arm is a little sore but not super stiff or painful. Now I just need my second shot in 3 weeks. I am feeling much less anxious.. It\\'s funny when people talk about long-term side effects....ask them for an example of one. Better yet, ask them what it\\'s like in the future seeing as they\\'ve been there to know about said side effects.. I got the Moderna first shot a little over a week ago. I had a very sore arm the next day, and a slight headache. The strangest thing that happened is that two days afterward, the inside of my nose and sinuses completely dried out to the point it was very, very uncomfortable - something that has never happened to me before. Never any fever or anything else. I went and got a covid test day before yesterday just to make sure I hadn\\'t caught covid around the time I got the vaccine, and the test was negative. So it\\'s either a side effect to the vaccine or a completely unrelated but coincidental illness like perhaps an allergy. It\\'s clearing up. I wouldn\\'t let this experience stop me from getting the second shot, because I can\\'t conclusively attribute the dryness to the vaccine, and even if I could, it didn\\'t significantly impair me in any way. I\\'d say overall that the side effects from the shot were pretty mild.. After a very long conversation with a gentleman who is anti-vaxx on a local news page because ‚Äúthe COVID vaccine is experimental and takes more than one dose so it‚Äôs obviously a conspiracy‚Äù and ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt even get the flu vaccine right,‚Äù I went on to educate him about how most vaccines take more than one dose and how the flu works. This was his response. [more here](https://imgur.com/gallery/wplCn85)\\n\\nETA: to be clear both of these comments are from him. Apparently I am the one ‚Äúparroting narratives‚Äù. Imagine calling someone a nurse as an insult lmao.. I love that \"no understanding of the science\" is alongside \"fully capable of reading the package inserts\"...\\n\\nNo.\\n\\n The inserts (PIL - Patient Information Leaflet in Europe) are written for the layman. The technical version is the SPC (Specification of Product Characteristics) and you should be able to find both with a Google - the UK repository is [https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc).. My favorite anti vax argument right there. The vaccine insert one, is so hilariously stupid. \\n\\nDon\\'t trust anything Big Pharma has to say\\n\\nBig pharma\\'s vaccine inserts are 100% accurate. \\n\\nHad a lady slap me for asking why the contradiction. Worth it though.. As someone who is studying biopharma this person can go fuck them selves with a rotten cucumber as they clearly can‚Äôt read data with no incite on the testing process of vaccines. First jab 2 weeks ago. I was a Registered Nurse for many years. No stroke yet.... &gt;You have no idea who I am\\n\\nWe get it, you flunked kindergarten, you don\\'t have to brag about it.. Good grief. I had to point out to my mom that this vaccine is safer than the live polio vaccine she would have gotten as a kid. I have such confidence in it‚Äôs safety, I would be willing to sign my preschooler up for clinical trials whenever they start them for 3 year olds.. LOL. ‚Äúzero understanding of the actual science speaking as if they‚Äôre subject matter experts?‚Äù says the person who has *zero understanding of the actual science and thinks they‚Äôre an expert on the subject matter.*. &gt;this one vaccine rushed through in under a year from start to finish, this ones safe, even though people are stroking out left and right\\n\\nI\\'m in the Moderna trial. I received my second dose last September (Moderna trial unblinded recently). I have had precisely zero strokes.. Antivaxxers are having a field day with the COVID vaccine. I‚Äôve already received both doses while pregnant due to my high risk profession. I have been told I‚Äôve killed my baby and even that he will be born with ‚Äúthe mark of the beast‚Äù. The irony of this is that I have a bachelor and masters in Biochem and work in healthcare and have an in depth understanding of the risk and benefits of my decision. Baby looked perfect on the last ultrasound, but I‚Äôll let you guys know if he‚Äôs born with horns or something.. ‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôm going to insult this person by telling them they have a really good job and work harder for their kids then most moms‚Äù. Yeah like nurses don‚Äôt know anything about research or clinical studies, their Google search history is clearly superior. I love that their base argument to most people is that they\\'re not medical professionals so who are they to weigh in... yet when actual medical professionals ALL side with vaccination then they\\'re corrupted by Big Pharma.. &gt;does anyone else get tired of [people] who have zero direct understanding of the actual science speaking of they are subject master experts?\\n\\nWow! This is peak r/selfawarewolves unless this person has a degree in a field related to vaccines... Oh wait, I forgot they think degree=shills and that 10 minutes reading a blog &gt; years of medical school.\\n\\nBTW, for anyone wondering: yes! 1 year is a record time to create a vaccine... If you are creating it from scratch. There were a lot of coronavirus  research teams (not sars-cov2, but coronaviruses in general) around the globe studying how to create a vaccine that targets coronaviruses. Fortunately, lots of these findings could be used to target sars cov2. Also, the fact that governments and private businesses invested heavily in the research and development of said vaccine helped out A LOT. \\n\\nI guess, what I\\'m saying is :trust and invest in science, its a good thing when you question science and safety protocols, but do use critical thinking and the correct information.\\n\\nI can\\'t stress this enough:the fact that you (in this case, antivaxxers) don\\'t understand the scientific basis, is not an argument against the research.\\n\\nEdit: readability. Would love to meet some of these patients who have been paid \"billions.\". Being a nurse obviously isn‚Äôt qualifying. You have to read a bunch of debunked conspiracies to *really* be informed /s. But.... to be a registered nurse (RN) you need a bachelor of SCIENCE in nursing (BScN) and you need to write the NCLEX exam to actually practice. At least where I\\'m from..... They\\'re not even giving the vaccine to babies though, are they?. Oh, you went to school for 4 years to become a nurse and had to study medical sciences? Well too bad, you don‚Äôt understand the science ü§¶üèª\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è. Did you end up telling him he was wrong and you are neither? Lol. \"You misunderstand the science\" says the antivaxxer. I don‚Äôt know anyone that stroked out from the shot but I do know people who died from Covid üíÅüèª\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è. \"who have zero understanding of the actual science\"\\n\\nAlright, which one of these two has a great chance to have a nursing degree? One who eat every misinformation or some person who‚Äî oh, I don\\'t know, STUDIED nursing?. Does direct understanding mean being the one to have actually discovered each and every concept you are speaking of ?. r/selfawarewolves. A nurse *and* a single mom! Wow, you must be one of the most productive and hardworking members of society! Sounds to me like they were trying to complement you! üòÇ. Me- medical scientist now nurse and also single mom: Ohno. Whatever will I do with that comment. Yeah, I need to stop going on this subreddit. Stupidity always ruins my day.. ‚ÄúDoes anyone else get tired of ‚Äúrandom Facebook mums‚Äù who have zero direct understanding of the actual science speaking as if they‚Äôre subject matter experts?‚Äù\\n\\nHoly r/SelfAwareWolves. This is soo First World Problem.These idiots have too much free time in their hand.Its like complaining about starbucks giving your coffee 10 min late.. I was just diagnosed with COVID19 by rapid test yesterday, but fortunately my fever\\'s already broke and I\\'m feeling better.  \\n\\nStill probably going to get the vaccine, I heard that it really improves your 5G reception!  \\n^(/s don\\'t lynch me). At this point i just think that these people should die right as i write that comment. All of them. Humans should only be alive if they contribute with something useful.. It\\'s like reverse survivorship-bias...\\n\\nThey specifically look for people who suffered severe side-effects from vaccines, instead of the millions of people who didn\\'t, and were just fine.\\n\\nIt\\'d be nice if they did this for \"alternative\" medical products these types promote, see how their negative statistics compare. I\\'d be curious to see the side-by-side for sure.. Bruh I think I just lost a few brain cells. They are literally making stuff up. The modern vaccines used in the West, particularly the covid one, have no history of major side effects. Even if a vaccine does have a small risk (like the OPV in India for example), eliminating devastating diseases in the population is far more crucial. All they have to do is Google the subject and read hundreds of expert opinions on the safety of vaccines. I don\\'t understand how these people\\'s brains work.. Notably for example the FSME vaccine, coming in at 3-4 doses for immunity. I don‚Äôt see anyone calling that one a hoax despite taking a record amount of doses to work.. OoOoOoOooOh vacwine swawy. Can I just say it always makes me confused when they say somebody has been injured by a vaccine. Injured only really denotes a physical harm to me...so anytime you get a shot, you are injured by a vaccine.\\n\\nI know what they mean, but it just always gets me.. Right?! Meanwhile I‚Äôve heard of parents in third world nations lining up for hours on end to vaccinate their kids. Because they KNOW the alternative risk they‚Äôre running.. Peeople who have lost family members and friends: bruh. Oh? And where did they get that trivia from? Facebook Karen with her associates in nursing(so she totally knows), or maybe from some of our good crossover buddies from antimlm? Either way, let\\'s see some statistics and papers luv. I\\'m a numbers guy!. Idiots. \\nFirst of all it\\'s not mandatory(unfortunately). Second nobody is dying from it. My own parents have had it for hell\\'s sake. Third there\\'s nothing unsafe about it, as it\\'s the same vaccine technique we\\'ve been using for two generations.. I don\\'t know about the Zuck at times. I think it\\'s going to be a real long time before he really does the right thing and gets all of this misinformation off FB..... Me praying I can get the Covid vaccine soon.. I saw this on Twitter. It\\'s beautiful!. Wow I can\\'t believe I just watched the whole thing. Long but well made. Got a few laughs too. Or, and hear me out on this, Apple can use your phone to harvest data on human processes. Well, I certainly don‚Äôt believe it. Imagine using the information harvesting tracking device to post about how they want to inject another one. Did everybody clap?\\n\\nWas that young man named...Albert Einstein? \\n\\nDid the beer fill in the cracks and he said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs always room for a little beer with friends‚Äù?. He‚Äôs not a very good secrets employee if he just tells all of apple‚Äôs secrets to a random person at a restaurant. Apple should fire this guy. I‚Äôm going to go with ‚Äúnot‚Äù.. Oh god they\\'re verified. Didn‚Äôt block the name out right since I can still read it\\n\\nDr. Naomi Wolf. Apple execs **love** dim sum. Checks out to me!. And everyone clapped too. I just want dim sum now.. I think this might\\'ve been a joke, cause anti-vaxxers would\\'ve used an unreasonable amount of Caps and phrases like \"Saved my Baby\" and \"Wake up Sheeple\". This is much to eloquent for an anti-vaxxer. The question I have is, \"executive *what*?\" It could have been somebody\\'s executive assistant with a fondness for dim sum and dim people.. I choose not.. Leaving the apple stuff aside, I\\'d love to hear his explanation for why they were seated so close to another table that they could clearly hear their conversation, in the middle of a pandemic.. Okay, I\\'ll choose \"or not\".. Antibody-conjugated nanoparticles have actually been an increasingly common thing in biotech.  I just suspect this guy just woefully misunderstood what was going on.. Dim sum-thin really stupid to believe.. I\\'m pretty sure if you were going to have a secret convention you wouldn\\'t put the name of your company in the title of said convention.. Nice job censoring her name, couldn‚Äôt even tell it was Dr. Naomi Wolf!. Welp, I appreciate the choice on the matter because I, in fact, do not believe it.. Schizophrenics like dim sum too I guess.. Are dim sum places even open right now?. I\\'ve had dreams where I wake up and remember the things that happened in the dream as stuff that\\'s happened in real life, but holy shit.. After the executive revealed this stunning piece of info everyone in the restaurant clapped.. of all the things that didn\\'t happen, this didn\\'t happen the most. &gt;Believe it or not\\n\\nI\\'ll take \"not\" for $100, Alex.. I refuse to believe that person is a doctor. This account is a VERIFIED one. And if you zoom in close, you can see that they are a DOCTOR.. The only dim here is the nitwit OP making up this shit.. I got the vaccine recently. And surprisingly enough i have zero nanobots in my body and no augmentations to my DNA or RNA. I would also like to say, thank you to Apple‚Ñ¢ for continuely delivering products that are above standard compared to other products on the market. Make sure you also buy new Apple‚Ñ¢ products in the future and expose your self to the covid 19¬Æ vaccine brought to you by Pepsi¬©.. Believe it or not... I\\'m going to not believe that, thanks. Amazing how all of these people regularly talk to/ overhear conversations from very important members of apple, microsoft, big pharma, nasa, etc, but they can never ever name the person they overheard or give any kind of identification about who it was. Sounds to me like they never actually checked that the person, had they existed, was not full of shit. But hey can you blame them? I too believe absolutely everything I overhear at restaurants from strangers.. I‚Äôm going with or not. Well, you‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt believe it.. Not. Yes everyone knows people discuss highly classified information in public where anyone can hear it tahts just common sense. I do not.. Apple exec- hahaha I think it\\'s so great were sitting here in this restaurant, after going to that top secret convention about people taking vaccine delivered nanoparticles and harvesting human processes, and talking freely to everyone about it! God life is so great!. I can‚Äôt get my ear pods to connect consistently to anything that‚Äôs older than 3 years. Don‚Äôt get me started on my power cords. Calm down anti-vaxxers, even if Apple is injecting you with nanotechnology, it will probably be obsolete by the next software update.. &gt;Believe it or not\\n\\nI\\'m going to choose \"not\" since \"harvest human processes\" doesn\\'t make sense.. Please harvest some of my human processes I am so tired of doing things. &gt;Believe it or not\\n\\nI\\'ll take \\'not\\', thanks.. I choose not to believe it.. So apparently there was a top seekrit convenshon where apple did presentations about all their evil plans and there was not one single leak about it?  Thank god this person just happened to be at the right restaurant at the right time!  Whew!. \"believe it or not...\"\\nI think not. I\\'m going to go with not, and move on with my day.. And what‚Äôs apple gonna do when I repair my vaccine chip with unofficial apple parts??? Lmaoooo. In this case, Mr. Ripley, I shall choose ... \"not\".. I chose not.. &gt;Believe ir or not\\n\\nEveryone knows anything said after \"believe it or not\" is 100% undeniable true facts. Not. I choose not.. Or not. Twitter for iPhone. \"Believe it or not\"... So... _not_?. I do wish these anti-vaxxers were more creative with their fiction.  They could make a shit ton getting novels published.  Sadly, like their science knowledge, their creative writing skills are pretty much non-existent.. Belive It\\n\\nOr\\n\\nNot ‚úÖ. To be fair, they said ‚ÄúBelieve it **or not**‚Äù. r/thathappened.. r/thathappened. This person doesn‚Äôt understand what almost any of the words in this post mean.. What they heard was a programmer that said he got a virus and it killed all the children.\\n\\nAnd they misunderstood that as this.. This can\\'t be true because they didn\\'t mention Bill Gates!. ‚ÄúTwitter for iPhone‚Äù. They are already tracking you, friend.. You, a nobody, who eats in a standard \"nobody\" restaurant, were sat next to an apple executive in which he gloats openly about secrets about a technology that doesn\\'t exist outside fiction?\\n\\n\\nYeah believable.. This sounds like the line from a discworld book where a wizard would use a match and magnifying glass to light a pipe. There are much easier ways to light like a match.. Was this overheard in a hipster coffee shop by any chance? Didn\\'t realize that Jacob Wohl was an antivaxxer.. Awesome! That should boost my Apple stocks considerably.. They lost me at ‚Äútop secret Apple convention‚Äù.. I feel like if they actually knew anything about nanoparticles they would be more concerned about them than the conspiracies surrounding them.\\n\\nLike, Nike odor eliminating nanoparticles? That shit will literally enter your brain. When they get in your body, they bypass the blood brain barrier and nestle into your cranium. Your body can\\'t get hot enough to break them apart without literally melting your brain. So they just stay there. We don\\'t know what they\\'re going to do once they\\'re in there. But it\\'s safe to assume nothing good.\\n\\nGet off apple\\'s back lady, your enemy isn\\'t apple in this instance, its American corporations that do not have to prove their products are harmful when they put them on the market.. ‚ÄúWas LOUDLY boasting‚Äù. There, I fixed it for you.. oh no! not my processes! anything but that!. So many antivaxxers make bullshit all the time but do ya ever wonder if one of em is close to being right?. They would know about dim sum, since they are one dim sumbitch.. My good God this woman is off her rocker. She posted a video about being in \\'Twitter jail\\' because of her lunatic ramblings... A little sprinkle of willful disinformation on top of a confirmation bias cake and you got the perfect conspiracy theorist\\'s dessert ready to serve.. I can read through your pencil scribble. If I can have nanobots to control my shit so I don\\'t have to say \"Okay Google\" 10 times before it registers while I\\'m driving, I\\'m in.. See this page get less likes and comments every day love it. Human processes, target outcomes. I\\'m an. Emu.. What did chance the rapper say in response ?. And I was seated by chance next to a global cabal of pedophile Nazi puppy murderers over tacos who boasted about tweeting vaccine conspiracy and that they identify each other by the code phrase of \"vaccines causes autism\". The last part of that paragraph gave me a stroke. The whole COVID vaccine nanotechnology thing is stupid. Any papers talking about it said that they were looking at nanoparticles to clad the fragile vaccine during delivery. Amazingly, this person doesn\\'t get confused by that, but thinks that a coating material is essentially a nanochip.. The only part of that post that I believe is that she was in a dim sum restaurant, this isn\\'t an action movie and slapping a few \\'sciency\\' words together doesn\\'t mean its going to make sense. Vaccine delivered nanoparticles? Harvesting human processes? Bitch how tf do you harvest cellular respiration or the cell cycle? Does she mean organs or body parts? Much easier way, just start robbing hospitals, morgues, or just fucking kill people. How do you even know he was an Apple executive? What was his name? Did he walk in with a pin on saying \"top level executive for apple\"? How do you know he was even being honest about anything? Smh.. im like 50/50 on this being a some eastern psy-op specifically to done to damage the west or we\\'re really this fucking dumb.. Not my target outcomes! Tell apple to keep its child snatching thief hands off my target outcomes.. considering apples stance on privacy, no chance.. Believe it or not, I am the president of the universe, send me doge or you\\'ll go to universe jail\\n\\nDUG3fSybpisoJ3hh6amDtAdtD3fLTTeezv. \"harvest human processes or target outcomes\"\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m being really dumb here, but serious question, the hell does that actually mean? What human processes do our blood know about that we don\\'t already? I thought we had a pretty solid understanding of anatomy or am I wrong about that?. And then everyone clapped... Can... can someone tell me what exactly a harvestable human process is? And while these nano ninjas are at it, can they do something about my narcolepsy? Or my migraines? Just reboot the whole system? Thanks.. This is a toughy but I think I‚Äôll go with ... Not. Satire as fuk. I read this as Applebee\\'s and was very impressed.. They just make up these terms. It‚Äôs ridiculous.. Well, I know what my loud conversation will \"be about\" next time I\\'m in a sit down restaurant.. Oh yeah? \\n\\nWell I sat next to John Stamos on a plane and he told me I was really pretty \\n\\nAnd this definitely totally happened and is not a rip off quote from Mean Girls. Ahhhh yes. I remember my days as an admiral in the First Division Mars Corps telling everyone within ear shot that JFK blows Hoffa nightly in space.. Sure, Betty.. Yeah, based on what I know about Apple‚Äôs secrecy and hush-hushed attitude about the things they haven‚Äôt announced, there‚Äôs no way he would keep his job after outing that in a public building.. Someone is dim sum.. If I worked for Apple would love to make that conversation on a crowded restaurant to see how many people falls for it.... Imma call BS, but in the world of anti-vaxxers, that with no evidence is gospel and facts are hearsay. This twit will be recited in the future as proof of whatever conspiracy theory is the flavor of the day.. Excellent censorship, i must say.. I don\\'t believe it..your a liar and a Q believer.. It is infuriating how dickheads make up stories.. Not. I‚Äôm guessing it wasn‚Äôt Apple employees. They probably saw the guy‚Äôs tinfoil hat in a public place and just had some fun. \\n\\nReally, that‚Äôs the only plausible explanation if he really did hear something like this.. \"twitter for iphone\". Whenever someone stars telling me something by saying ‚Äúbelieve it or not,‚Äù I do not believe that thing.. A+ job on not showing her nameüòÇ. You know what, it\\'s time to say this: anyone who gets paid to track my nanobot in my body is in for a surprise- I do nothing of interest. You got a boring project ahead.. I choose not. Hi, yea PhD here in Materials Engineering who works with nanoparticles. Yea that\\'s uh, that\\'s not how they work.. \"Twitter for iPhone\".. Believe it or not- NOT. DONE.. His name? Albert Einstein.. I seriously doubt any Apple executives are eating at the same restaurants as the average Joe, nevermind loudly discussing something that could get them fired if found out.. I don\\'t believe it. Thank you for giving me that option.. &gt; believe it or not\\n\\nNo I don‚Äôt think I will. I wonder if they mean nano robots, or something similar.  \\n\\nDoesn‚Äôt matter, though. If the govt wants to put nano whatever in you, vaccines aren‚Äôt the only way. If I was tasked with coming up with a vector, I‚Äôd just use the water supply. :/. You should show up with your own sign. \\n\\n‚ÄòNo they do not‚Äô. Ugh a few months ago I had the same thing happen on a major highway I drive to school and work. They posted these large antivaxx banners on bridges over the highway for nearly 15 miles. It was excessive, and highly depressing to see them claiming that same shit. \\n\\nThe road is heavily used to reach the major university hospital, and attached large reference laboratory.. Lol I just think it‚Äôs funny that it looks like their legitimately asking, like instead of google they thought, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard a lot of things about vaccines and I‚Äôm curious for answers,‚Äù *looks around room and sees laptop* ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way anything in this room could possibly answer my question, welp, best get a sharpie and some cardboard and make my way to the freeway‚Äù. I love how it\\'s a question. Like, maybe just ask your doctor.. It makes sense that antivaxxers are prolifers, you gotta stay true to the whole ‚Äúchildren matter but only if they are unborn‚Äù. This belongs in r/oldpeoplefacebook. Clearly they don‚Äôt understand how to googles.. I\\'m very sorry you were exposed to these eyesores. As far as I know, posting signs on bridges over highways has been one of their recent propaganda campaigns. \\n\\nIt seems dangerous and downright silly to me. When I\\'m driving, I focus on the road, not some sign on a bridge.\\n\\nIn any case, the answer to the question posed on the sign is simple: NO. No, they don\\'t contain \"aborted human fetal tissue\" (some viruses for vaccines are grown using a human cell line established from an aborted fetus from the 60s, as such, the cells have nothing to do with the original anymore, and they are not in the final product as the cells are destroyed when the viruses are harvested) and they don\\'t sterilize you (how would that even work! It seems to be one of the favourite Anti-Vax tropes, I\\'ve seen it about the DTaP vaccine, about the HPV vaccine and now they\\'re targeting the Covid vaccines).. Is fertility really a concern for folks over 60 tho. I work with covid patients too, have for months... my heart goes out to you, you are right to feel upset ‚ù§Ô∏è. How the fuck? The folks who are putting up that trash wouldn‚Äôt have been born if that was the case.. You should buy time on an Electronic Billboard:  \"Ignore the Anti Vaxxers on the bridge\". Betteridge\\'s law!. Considering the population growth rate of our species I\\'d have to say no. No, vaccines are not causing us to be sterile.. That is much appreciated, I hope that wherever you are, the census decreases and your nose remains free of skin breakdown. Lord,.help these idiots. But i would like to seeing their \\'reasoning\\'. \"Can I start off by-\"\\n\\nIdk, can you?. That gave me flashbacks to grammar school. Ah, so this is how they intend to keep the virus around, eh?. Spreading a plague to US citizens, seems impeachable doesn\\'t it, oh what\\'s that he\\'s democrat. Ahhh gotcha nevermind then .. Once again r/politics tell us how this is ok. This is how they intend to hold the virus over the country‚Äôs head to control the population. By letting in illegal immigrants who test positive for COVID-19 someone like Fauci will say ‚ÄúWell we still haven‚Äôt reached herd immunity, there are still cases out there, keep wearing masks...lockdowns till 2022/2024...(election years)‚Äù and thus the Democrats roll into the each election cycle with an excuse for voting from home, online, over the phone.  Manipulation again will be rampant.. What‚Äôs a great way to spread viruses and diseases?  Letting random illegal untested immigrants from other countries across our border to freely mingle in our population centers.  That‚Äôs how.. They‚Äôre going to let in thousands of infected illegals into Texas and if cases take a climb they‚Äôll screech some more and put sole blame Abbott for lifting the mask mandate.. Wow. That‚Äôs crazy. Who would have thought!!  But at least the Rinos helped remove Trump so....  you should thank those Never Trump RINO‚Äôs for what‚Äôs happening g today.. And like a gun, Biden will aim these illegals into Texas so that they can say \"Texas opening up caused a spike in COVID cases!\". Didn\\'t you see his press conference yesterday, he said they can handle the crisis at the border, C\\'mon man!. Bus them up to DC, and let the \"lawmakers\" greet each and every one of them to welcome them to what was a great country...... Every Covid death is on his hands! \\n\\nThat‚Äôs how this works right?. What happened to sheltering in place...?. My recent email to my (D) representative (Darren Soto):\\n\\n&gt;Representative Soto-- What is going through the minds of Democrats today?  This morning I find this news article: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/after-border-patrol-release-asylum-seekers-test-positive-covid-brownsville-n1259282\\n&gt;\\n&gt;First, why are Democrats letting ILLEGAL ALIENS into the country, and second, why are they letting ILLEGAL ALIENS into the country that are testing positive for COVID-19?   Can you please answer these questions? \\n&gt;\\n&gt;I sincerely hope that you are against these activities, and are working to pass legislation that would prevent these kinds of events in the future.  You represent the American citizens in your district, Mr. Soto.  I have yet to see evidence that you\\'re taking your responsibilities very seriously.. I guess we\\'re not in a pandemic anymore. Masks for the remainder of your life.. This is absolutely asinine. We are still dealing with a pandemic and have record high unemployment. There absolutely no reason we should be allowing illegals in.. American citizens can‚Äôt leave their houses, but the border is wide open to anyone who wants to come in.. Gotta keep control somehow.. We will let unlimited illegal aliens free in your community and have BLM protests for months straight but god forbid you don‚Äôt wear a mask lmfao what a clown show. I don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs not like the US doesn‚Äôt accept the most immigrants out of any country, where‚Äôs the gratitude? Instead democrats accuse us of being racist if we try and have borders. Seriously wrf. Oh, that‚Äôs why I still have to wear a mask. Thanks, great policy for Americans.. If they can move about freely, what was the point of the last 12 months of lockdowns?? I now identify as an illegal immigrant and don‚Äôt have to pay taxes because of my sovereignty, or something.. So he\\'s intentionally spreading a disease on the American public,it\\'s time to remove this entire administration from office.. Biden: Plan I together it when comes love \\n\\nMedia: What?\\n\\nBiden: What?\\n\\nMedia: Texas bad!. I‚Äôm pretty certain that Democrats will vaccinate illegal immigrants before they vaccinate our school teachers, if the plot requires it.. To all th3 nevertrump tools who were aghast at mean tweets... thanks. I hope a family of yellow jackets make a home in your groin.. How much of this will be Trump\\'s fault?. Let‚Äôs not blame this on Biden or the immigrants, we can blame it on Abbott for lifting the mask mandate (next week).. Of course they do.  Did we really expect anything different?. Masks mean nothing to these people, let them in and watch cases explode.... This is a big story.. Migrants need Medicare, and voting rights, and public housing, chicken in every pot, company cars, free educationpersonal shoppers a credit card.. Just remember, this is all Governor Abbott\\'s fault for lifting mask mandates. Each and every COVID case from here on out will solely be because of that decision. Cheers!. What are the ramifications if a person shoots an illegal in self defense? Is there even a trial?. This thread is bombarded by folks claiming that Biden has a nefarious agenda by intentions bringing in COVID infected individuals into the country, yet also claiming that Texas is ready for a full reopening.... I don\\'t really get the logical disconnect here, which leads me to believe this sentiment is clearly purely politically based. It should be clear that at this point 1 infected individual won\\'t make a meaningful difference in the numbers we are seeing... The virus is already here and in full spread, the only impactful response we can have to minimize the deaths will be to quickly provide vaccinations across the country and continue to maintain masks and social distancing until we reach herd immunity. My main concern with abandoning the restrictions in place would be a COVID mutation resulting from increased spread and exposure to vaccinated individuals, which could result in a COVID strain that\\'s and to infect even vaccinated individuals. We are 2 months away from a real finish line here, why are we abandoning the most effective tools we have to up Texas just before we get everyone immunized? And why is the conversation focused on a hand full of migrants that may have covid, when the number of cases has never been a focus on this sub?. Winning.. I thought conservatives didn‚Äôt believe in infectious diseases?\\n\\nThey can just go to Texas or Mississippi, where viruses don‚Äôt exist.. You thought wrong.  Now you know.. Can‚Äôt respect anything he says about Covid.  I can respect a man who sets rules he thinks is best and follows them.  Can‚Äôt take someone seriously who sets rules and violates them to then judge others. No one in Texas gives a fuck what that clown thinks or tweets. How does he even have the balls to tweet that when he\\'s been caught breaking his own rules twice??. Californians are leaving for Texas, ie Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. Newsom should get a clue.. I\\'m sorry, who\\'s the one facing a recall election?. What\\'s *absolutely reckless* is the California mismanagement and corruption under  Newsom\\'s reign that\\'s gotten hordes of them seeking refuge here in Texas.. California has outbreaks of tuberculosis, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, typhus, shigella, mumps, trench fever, and plenty more because of its policies of welcoming illegal immigrants and allowing \"tent cities\" of homeless people in the streets. Newsom and California as a whole has no ground to stand on when it comes to talking about how to handle a disease.. You really think he got caught every time?. He probably did it more than the 2 times he got caught. He just got caught twice.. Gavin can‚Äôt wrap his pea brain mind around what Texas did because he doesn‚Äôt understand the basic concepts of freedom.. reckless... how do you give the common folk their freedoms back? Once we take them, we don\\'t give them back. what are you doing? Why are you you being so reckless with other peoples freedom?. Everyone forgetting he\\'s just as guilty as Cuomo. \\n\\nhttps://townhall.com/columnists/larryoconnor/2021/02/19/gavin-newsoms-cuomostyle-nursing-home-scandal-n2585014. The absolute fucking cheek on this guy to tweet out ANYTHING about handling COVID\\n\\nHey Gavernor, as one of your constituents: shut up. LOL. California is a literal mental asylum in a garbage dump where the patients are in charge and they\\'re worried people want to go there? LMFAO. Newsom is absolutely a dumbass. California‚Äôs 40% population is on welfare. 20-25% population is illegal. They don‚Äôt want freedom or protect their rights. They prefer free welfare. I prefer to compare them with caged pets with no dignity.  \\nThey love this moron Newsom, because he had been giving them everything free.. Newsom can shove his head up his ass üí©ü§™üí©. What if we told you that just because it\\'s no longer the law that you must wear a mask doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t keep wearing a mask if you want to, or you can\\'t stay in your house, or you can\\'t require masks for your business, or you can\\'t leave the state?. Texas had a case rate of 92,036 per million. They have not been as insanely locked down as California and their economy is not a dumpster fire like Newsom‚Äôs state. California is roughly the same with 90,542 cases per million. Texas has a 7.2% unemployment rate. California has a 9% unemployment rate. 49th in the nation. \\n\\nThe left coast can keep the grossly incompetent Gavin .. I always think it‚Äôs ridiculous when people make a profile pic of them wearing a mask. You could take the pic in complete privacy and show your whole face but you decide to wear the mask. \\n\\nIt‚Äôd be like me wearing a football helmet to take my selfie in because I played football for a brief time in my life.. Man, I live in CA.  I\\'m glad Texas is opening.  Newsome is an absolute pile of shit, in every sense of the word.  There are a lot of \"normal\" rational Californians here but there are so many out of touch liberals, it\\'s insane.  Texas should screen Californians before allowing them to move to their state.  It would be great if Texans had a mass migration here and flipped this state on it\\'s ass and spanked until it turned \"red.\". Gavin is just another dictator, angry that people dare to think for themselves.   Fuck him.. COVID isn\\'t even a government vs populace thing for me.\\n\\nI wear a mask every day but even in a state where they\\'re mandated, I see entire families without them in public.\\n\\nI\\'m a statistician and it\\'s a data thing.\\n\\nWhen you tally up countries by COVID death rate vs prolonged mandated containment measures, there are basically no correlations. It seems to depend far more on when they got hit, which strain they got hit with, and the percentage of their population who are very elderly.\\n\\nHowever that does not interested Karen on Facebook. That\\'s boring. That\\'s a boring chart. She wants RADICAL ACTION AGAINST THESE MURDERERS etc.\\n\\nLike practically everything else in modern America, it\\'s mostly tribal signalling. Nobody bothers you if you\\'re of a protected ethnocultural background but if you aren\\'t, you get threatened or arrested.. These people should just stay in their basement and waste away, living their life completely without risk forever.  Clearly they have no ability to make risk assessments, but they think they know what‚Äôs best for the rest of the country.. If there was any doubt this was the right choice...now we can be absolutely positive.. üòÜ\\n\\nOh wait, he‚Äôs serious? Let me laugh even harder.\\n\\nü§£. Elitists feel entitled. They have a sense of self entitlement that overrides their common sense. Hopefully, most Americans can see and recognize the hypocrisy of the elitists.. Any word newsom types or breathes is worthless. He really tweeted that??  Wow.. Seriously though, I really wish we could put in place a law to prevent people from California from moving to Texas. I hate to say it but Texas seems like its fucked in the future with all the new liberal children moving here.. Bold of you to assume there were only 2 times.. Says the guy who is looking at getting recalled for his failures.. What‚Äôs the risk? He‚Äôs above such notions of law and order. Newsom has plenty of time to tweet, but no time to fix the EDD, which lost over $10 billion to unemployment fraudsters and is now sending 1099 forms to some of the people who were victimized.. Dude‚Äôs about to get recalled but yeh, criticize other governors lol. I simply made the comment. Well someone has to be first. About this and got down voted into the basement.In r/politics. Some balls this guy has. Oh God, Gavin Newsom\\'s hypocrisy is painful. How is he still in office? When is the recall? They have twice as many signatures as they need.. This fuckstick has absolutely decimated our economy. Further, he‚Äôs done nothing but push climate hysteria bullshit and identity politics. Poster child for progressive kleptocrats. And sadly, a large number of Californians consider him the best governor ever.. Said the guy getting recalled.... Yellow tier in California is when a county has less than 1 case per 100,000. That‚Äôs when Disneyland is finally allowed to open at 25% capacity.\\n\\nDestroying our CA economy? That‚Äôs reckless!. Kim jong newsom thinks freedom is \"reckless\". Shocking.. Personally, I don\\'t think it\\'s the best of ideas to be lifting the mask mandate quite yet but I think hypocrites have no right to call people out on things if they themselves have done something they shouldn\\'t involving it.. No, he got caught twice, we don‚Äôt know how many times he dined out total.. Those people have so little self awareness I sometimes wonder if they are actual people instead of some faulty AI with a body double.. I live in Cali. My daughter just got an email from AMC where she worked before COVID. They are reopening in the next month. BUY NOW. Gavin is doing damage control because they are trying to stretch this out till the 2022 voting. Them mail in Ballots are the dems life line.. Recall this F‚Äông jack ass.. Getting his ass recalled. Gavin Newsom is one of the biggest pieces of shit walking the earth today. Just look at that smug fucking face of his.  Hey Gavin, seems pretty reckless to let people set up tents off the side of the 10 freeway does it not? Fuck this dude. Gavin the ü§°. The rest of the 50 states should follow Texas‚Äôs lead. These mandates are imposing on our civil rights. I think people were born with a brain in their head to make their own decisions about what‚Äôs best for their health.. It‚Äôs always amazing and weird how little people know and how well media can spin things.\\n\\nWe don‚Äôt have mask mandates in Ga, governor said it was unconstitutional. I assumed most states were that way, at least quite a few. Couldn‚Äôt believe Texas wasn‚Äôt one of those. No one‚Äôs complaining about or mentioning all of the states that never had mask mandates.\\n\\nPeople are sheep. They get mad at what the news and twitter tells them to get mad about. Licking your campaign manager‚Äôs wife‚Äôs asshole while you were in a committed relationship is absolutely reckless.. Ratio‚Äôd. [Wasn‚Äôt me](https://youtu.be/PlAoL2NPac8). Shut the fuck up gavin. Fuck Gavin newsom. Fairly certain two things can be reckless at the same time. Fault is not mutually exclusive. This is why american politics are a blazing dumpster fire. Both can be true. Newsome needs to mind his own sorry ass and not worry about other states. This guy ia a pathetic example of leadership, especially in CA. There\\'s a obvious reasons were recalling the son of a bitch.. Is this South Park? I swear this is South Park.. He looks like he doesn‚Äôt even lift.. If you\\'re so scared of the virus then just stay the fuck inside like you have been. Don\\'t force everyone else to live like they\\'ll die because you\\'re paranoid. Says the guy who‚Äôs state is about to fire him. He\\'s just butthurt that the Texas economy will now surpass California\\'s.. Out of curiosity  how is the power grid holding with the reopenings?\\n\\nIs the strain  causing  any  issues ?. Yeah, reckless is keeping California children out of school for a year! Newsom-you dumbass. How dare they let people make their own decisions on weather or not to social distance or go to public restaurants. Shame on them!. You can see why they are recalling this guy MAKE CALIFORNIA RED AGAIN!!!!!!.  Masks haven been extremely successful in helping fight COVID in Asians and Australia.. This guy is a piece of human trash.  He\\'s wannabe king. Yet stupid people re-elect him. I\\'m sure most of Texas considers him just as I described him.. Not only that but we have fewer cases today than when he dined out.. Newsom and Cuomo need to be sent out of the country. Whenever I see politicians just utterly avoid masking up,  or doing something incredibly selfish during a crisis in general , I just wonder:\\n\\nAren\\'t these people supposed to be at least somewhat smarter than your average guy? How did they become so successful in the first place by being *that* stupid?\\n\\nHow does a guy go to dine out during the worst months of pandemic on multiple occasions, yet be smart and savvy enough to get elected in the first place?. If you think him going out for dinner is an issue (it fucking is) then you shouldn\\'t be agreeing with the listing of this mask mandate.\\n\\nYet again something has happened, this sub completely ignored it and goes with \"b b b but a democrat did something too\" \\n\\nLifting the mask mandate will cost lives, and yet again I\\'ve lost more faith in this sub that I used to love.. Facts Gavin is a complete fool. Texas just keeps getting more awesome by the day.. Or ban Democrats moving from here to cali to Texas. Good to know we are not opening up ANYTIME soon!\\n\\nRECALL NEWSOM!. The gall on that fruitcake to say jack shit about anything.  That is a true sociopath we are staring at there.  You know that fucker is into some creepy shit.. Got Caught Twice =/= Only Dined Out Twice  \\n\\nI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs slithered out &amp; about numerous times and went unnoticed.. The reason Newsome and the Dems find Texas\\' action reckless, is because soon we\\'ll all find out this lockdown was bull$hit!. The virtue signaling masked profile pics are absolutely nauseating...and not to mention the fact that most people who use them are lying hypocrites. The state may take away the mask mandate, but that doesn\\'t mean that companies will drop their policies for wearing a mask. Especially if its a left wing company.. Nuisance is a clown.. How about California stay out of Texas business? I mean I get that you are upset because we are taking all your businesses away.. Looking for debate?

This WOKE virus will only be defeated, if it has consequences for the pandering state officials.. Many blue states at least considered this approach.. Why create another division between races? If your over the age of 65, signup and get the shot. Why do they need to know what race you are when signing up? We\\'re all americans. I fucking hate these politicians and officials. I think they should be the very last people to get the vaccine if they want to plays games like this. Just imagine how government run universal health care would prioritize certain groups over others based on skin color.. Sounds a bit racist to me. This is exactly what they want and preach. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*\"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination\" -* Ibram Kendi. I mean.. what did you expect?. I hate my fucking state. When this ideology is potentially killing people, will people stand up and oppose this totalitarian divisive obsession with race? What will it take for greater sense to prevail? For people to stand up and say, this is wrong and we won‚Äôt let this happen in our state‚Äù?. No clue why more states arent just doing lotteries. Assign number of drawings per population in each county and then draw for the 65+ base. You can take all politics out of it.. Well, I guess don\\'t vote in completely woke, leftist Democrats. This is what you get.. Virginia is a clusterfuck right now. My husband, a prosecutor, is getting denied the vaccine despite the fact that the state is in phase 1b. They lost my info when they consolidated the data, so I lost my place in line. We are not happy.. Man it\\'s painfully obvious that y\\'all didn\\'t read the actual press conference as it .\\nThey are allocating a small number of vaccines to go to areas where there is less access to vaccination sites in communities with populations that tend to fare worse with the virus (elderly black and latino for a variety of reasons).\\n\\nEDIT: Also to clarify they\\'ve only allocated about 800 vaccines to those areas out of the 130,000 a week they\\'re currently administering.. And that is not racism! Go figure.. \"EQUITY\". If this were a federal program, it would be a violation of Constitutional due process.  There\\'s also no medical reason for prioritizing one race over another.\\n\\nWith regards to COVID, black people and Latinos do have worse health outcomes than white people.  However, that is NOT because the virus itself is more deadly to people based off of their ethnicity and skin color.  Rather, that is a reflection of socioeconomics and, to a lesser extent, cultural norms.\\n\\nWhen looking at who should get the vaccine at an individual-by-individual basis, it absolutely comes down to who is at most risk for severe disease.  That necessitates an age-based, but race-blind approach.. No racism to see here folks...  Move along... It\\'s not racist if it\\'s against whites... Move along.... Easy solution- Just identify as black and then threaten them with a lawsuit if they refuse to vaccinate you.. I don‚Äôt disagree with this one. Black and Latino seniors have much worse covid outcomes than white seniors (which I think is at least partly because of genetic predisposition to clotting, etc). This will save more lives.\\n\\nNot ‚Äúlevel the playing field,‚Äù as when the CDC earlier (and many states are still following this) said a 20-year-old black person should get to  jump the line in front of a 70 year old white person ‚Äúbecause racism and this is a time to even the score,‚Äù which is freaking horrific.\\n\\nHad every part of the virus and the response to it not be politicized in the most demented way possible, maybe this policy wouldn‚Äôt stick out like it is.. The news is trying to make this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù more wanted by creating false scarcity.. Why does the government get to decide who gets the vaccine at all, especially along discriminatory lines?\\n\\nWe shouldn‚Äôt let the government control it at all.. So sad. It is so hard for you guys.. California is doing this too. My parents (nearing retirement age) aren\\'t able to get the vaccine, but they\\'re giving access if you\\'re part of a latino or black community. Absolutely disgusting.. People keep replying with off topic conservative talking points. This is discrimination based on race.   That is illegal. Why are people so desperate to get this vaccine in the first place. Covid isnt exactly real, but even if it was, the vaccine gives you a tiny 2 month window of immunity, followed by 6+ months of hyper vulnerability.. Why waste vaccines on 85+yo. That‚Äôs just dying with extra steps.

I\\'ll be honest, I was previously a little sceptical of this vaccine given it had been approved before any published efficacy data, but fair play as it actually looks to be very good. Only slight gripe is that 43 cases is a relatively small number of events for an analysis, but nothing looks untoward so far and there are bigger analyses to look forward to as the results come in.\\n\\n&gt;Hyderabad, India, 03, March, 2021: Bharat Biotech, a global leader in vaccine innovation, developing vaccines for infectious diseases, today announced the first interim analysis of its BBV152 (COVAXIN¬Æ). The whole virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated an interim vaccine efficacy of 81% in its Phase 3 clinical trial. The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest ever conducted in India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research.\\n\\n&gt;‚ÄúToday is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today‚Äôs results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.\\n\\n&gt;COVAXIN¬Æ demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID 19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,‚Äù said Dr. Krishna Ella, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Bharat Biotech.\\n\\n...\\n\\n&gt;The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.\\n\\n&gt;**The first interim analysis is based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 7 cases observed in the BBV152 (COVAXIN¬Æ) group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6%.**\\n\\n&gt;The interim analysis included a preliminary review of the safety database, which showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The trial\\'s conduct and monitoring are as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines and have been outsourced to IQVIA.\\n\\n&gt;Analysis from the National Institute of Virology indicates that vaccine-induced antibodies can\\nneutralize the UK variant strains and other heterologous strains, which has been published in bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.426986\\n\\n&gt;Bharat Biotech expects to share further details of the trial results as additional data become available. An additional interim analysis is planned for 87 cases, and the final analysis is planned for 130 cases. All data from the second interim and final analyses will be shared via prepublication servers as well as submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.. If inactivated vaccines are successfully treating Covid 19 why does the US insist on using mRNA? Is it better? I think we would have a lot more success in mass vaccinations because it‚Äôs ‚Äújust like a flu shot‚Äù. The US had three viable vaccines. Why are other countries having to come up with their own ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù. Seems like we could maybe share that kind of thing.. More research the better! Some countries, like India, have budding science programs and it would be a huge source of pride for their citizens to take a home grown vaccine. Also more supply of vaccine, the better! Lastly, when we first started out we knew someone of these vaccines wouldn\\'t work. Think if AZ, Moderna and Pfizer all didn\\'t work and then this vaccine results came along. We would all be celebrating Covaxin\\'s win.. They are being shared, as much as they can. The \"special sauce\" that makes the mRNA vaccines work is not something that just any company can rapidly stand up and start producing safely. The meme that says \"if we forced Pfizer to give up their patents everyone in the world could have this vaccine\" is fundamentally incorrect.\\n\\nhttps://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/02/02/myths-of-vaccine-manufacturing\\n\\nNow if we knew a priori a year ago that mRNA was going to be so successful there may have been an opportunity *then* to scale up all these previously obscure industries and production processes, but it was wise at the start of the pandemic not to put all of our vaccine eggs in one basket behind one technology.\\n\\nAnd given that all of the resulting vaccine technologies have had at least one hit on a highly effective vaccine, that was still a good move.. The phizer vacine is partly a German vacine.  The more vaccines the better since they all have trade-offs and different results against the variants.. **Please read before commenting.**\\n\\nKeep in mind this is a *science* sub.

Initially care home-residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and adults from age 80 were targeted. In phase 3 trials, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 demonstrated 95% and 70% efficacy, respectively, after two doses against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in elderly frail people. Evaluation following implementation to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly adults is urgent.\\n\\n**Methods:** A prospective single-centre test-negative design case-control study of adults aged ‚â•80 years hospitalised with COVID-19 disease or other acute respiratory disease. We conducted logistic regression controlling for time (week), gender, index of multiple deprivations (IMD), and care residency status (CRS), and sensitivity analyses matched for time and gender using a conditional logistic model adjusting for IMD and CRS.\\n\\n**Findings:** First dose vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.5-90.6). ChAdOx1nCoV-19 first dose vaccine effectiveness was 80.4% (95% CI 36.4-94.5). When effectiveness analysis for BNT162b2 was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1nCoV-19, the estimate was 79.3% (95% CI 47.0-92.5).\\n\\n**Interpretation:** A single dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine resulted in substantial reductions in the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in elderly, frail patients with extensive co-morbid disease.. So much data available yet certain regulators still won\\'t give Oxford/AZ full approval.. ‚ÄúWhen effectiveness analysis for BNT162b2 was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1nCoV-19, the estimate was 79.3%‚Äù can anyone explain what this means? Why is it higher than 71.4?.

Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use.\\n\\n**Methods**\\n\\nIn this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 micrograms recombinant spike protein with 50 micrograms Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy greater than or equal to 7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nA total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nThe NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.. I find it very peculiar that Novavax is 90% effective in the UK and 50% in SA, while J&amp;J 72% in the USA and 64% in SA. Ok that there are confidence bands, but the difference in trend is huge.. No efficacy of previous infection at preventing infection with 1.351. Hopefully it protects from severe disease though.. &gt; No efficacy of previous infection at preventing infection with 1.351.\\n\\nYou can\\'t really draw that conclusion because the seropositive patients are not a random sample. They may have higher exposure risk (explaining why they were previously exposed). I wouldn\\'t recommend drawing any conclusion from this; if seropositive patients are twice as likely to be reexposed as seronegative patients, the efficacy of natural infection would be comparable to that of the vaccine.

In the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were first administered to the public starting in December 2020, and no lactating women were included in the initial trials of safety/efficacy. Research on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lactating women and the potential transmission of passive immunity to the infant through breast milk is needed to guide patients, clinicians and policy makers during the worldwide effort to curb the spread of this virus.\\n\\n**Objective:** To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobins are found in breast milk post-vaccination, and to characterize the time course and types of immunoglobulins present. \\n\\n**Design:** Prospective cohort study\\n\\n**Setting:** Providence Portland Medical Center, Oregon, USA\\n\\n**Participants:** Six lactating women who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine between December 2020 and January 2021. Breast milk samples were collected pre-vaccination and at 11 additional timepoints, with last sample at 14 days post 2nd dose of vaccine.\\n\\n**Exposure:** Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\\n\\n**Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s):** Levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG immunoglobulins in breast milk.\\n\\n**Results:** In this cohort of 6 lactating women who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we observed significantly elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in breast milk beginning at Day 7 after the initial vaccine dose, with an IgG-dominant response.\\n\\n**Conclusions and Relevance:** We are the first to show that maternal vaccination results in SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins in breast milk that may be protective for infants.. While it is great that they did this study the conclusion is completely normal and expected. These antibodies behave the same as other antibodies.. How long would we expect passive immunity from breast milk to last?. This preliminary study matters; we need every possible piece of good news to help overcome vaccine hesitancy. A young, healthy nursing mom may be more likely to get vaccinated if she knows it could protect her baby.. What types of studies would be needed to prove that it gave children immunity?. Would it have the same effect on pregnant women who get the vaccine? Would antibodies pass to the baby through breast milk if a mother got the vaccine while pregnant?. 6 subjects is truly powerful enough? I mean I expect this result, but I feel like it isn\\'t very robust. ~~What was the p value?~~ I realize it isn\\'t this type of study.. Why couldn‚Äôt they have also offered some insight whether this alters the milk in any other way, to rule out adverse possibilities?.

In particular, sustained molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in mild to moderate COVID-19 is common and confounds surveillance efforts in the community. We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via longitudinal viral RNA, virus culture, and plasma and oral fluid antibody sampling in a prospective observational cohort study of adult outpatients with COVID-19. \\n\\n**Methods and Findings**\\n\\nSamples from 95 non-hospitalized participants ‚â• 30 years old with recent COVID-19 diagnosis and known symptom onset date were analyzed. Participants self-collected mid-turbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on 507 URT samples revealed a median time to viral RNA clearance of the URT of 33.5 days. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR positive samples tested. All participants but one with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The kinetics of oral fluid anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. The mean time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. Associations of symptoms, host demographics, comorbidities, and immune kinetics with time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies was independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.020). BMI ‚â• 25kg/m2 was also independently associated with a longer time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p=0.009). Fever reported as one of first three COVID-19 symptoms was associated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.18, p=0.044). Plasma titers of neutralizing antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies, and S-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies were obtained at 1-4 months post-symptom onset. BMI was positively correlated with post-acute plasma SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titer and anti-S-RBD antibody titer.\\n\\n**Conclusions**\\n\\nIn an intensively sampled cohort of 95 adult outpatients with COVID-19, we demonstrate that longer time to first detection of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with longer time to viral RNA clearance. This work provides insights into the host and immune factors most important for viral clearance in mild to moderate COVID-19.. **Please read before commenting.**\\n\\nKeep in mind this is a *science* sub.

Abstract\\n\\nThe type 2 coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and produces pneumonia with pulmonary alveolar collapse. In some cases it also causes sepsis and septic shock. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vitamin C (Vit C), Vitamin E (Vit E), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Melatonin (MT) increase the intracellular content of GSH, kidnap free radicals and protect DNA, proteins in the cytosol and lipids in cell membranes. Pentoxifylline (Px) has anti-inflammatory activities. Here we evaluate the effect of Vit C, Vit E, NAC, and MT plus Px in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe pneumonia. 110 patients of either sex were included. They were divided into five groups with 22 patients each. Group 1 received Vit C+Px, group 2 Vit E+Px, group 3 NAC+Px, group 4 MT+Px, and group 5 only Px. Oxidative stress (OS) markers such as lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and nitrites (NO2-) were evaluated in plasma. The antioxidant therapy improved the survival scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the Acute Physiology and chronic Health Evaluation II (Apache II), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), the Critical Illness Risk Score, Launched during COVID-19 crisis (COVIDGRAM) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We found that LPO was elevated (p‚â§0.04) and TAC (p‚â§0.03), NO2-\\xa0(p‚â§0.04) and inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6, p‚â§0.01) C reactive protein (CRP, p‚â§0.01) and procalcitonin (PCT, p‚â§0.05) were diminished in COVID-19 patients upon admission to the hospital. The different antioxidants reversed this alteration at the end of the treatment. The treatment with antioxidant supplements such as Vit C, E, NAC, and MT plus Px could decelerate the aggressive and lethal development of COVID-19. Antioxidant therapy can be effective in this pandemia since it improves the survival scores including SOFA, Apache II, SAPS II, COVIDGRAM, GCS by lowering the LPO, IL-6, CRP, PCT and increasing systemic TAC and NO2. **Please read before commenting.**\\n\\nKeep in mind this is a *science* sub.

To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern.\\n\\n**Design** Test negative case control design \\n\\n**Setting** Community COVID-19 PCR testing in England\\n\\n**Participants** All adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million). All COVID-19 testing in the community among eligible individuals who reported symptoms between 8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021 was included in the analysis.\\n\\n**Interventions** One and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine.\\n\\n**Main outcome measures** Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. \\n\\n**Results** Individuals aged &gt;=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen. Individuals aged &gt;=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.\\n\\n**Conclusion** Vaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (&gt;6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.. **Please read before commenting.**\\n\\nKeep in mind this is a *science* sub.

Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g., healthcare, office work). In-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, but this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.. I don\\'t se how this was actually worth a \"study\". It is literally stating the obvious, like \"If you drive fast on the highway at rush hour there is more chance to be involved in a fatal car accident than driving on a country road at 10km/h.

Abstract\\n\\nOne third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients‚Äô CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens‚Äîincluding one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.. ‚Äú one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue‚Äù \\nThis is concerning. Could vaccine induce the same harmful antibody?. **Reminder:** This post contains a **preprint** that has **not been peer-reviewed.**\\n\\nReaders should be aware that preprints have not been finalized by authors, may contain errors, and report info that has **not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.**\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.. The good news is that CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to the various peptides from all the major circulating strains are fairly stable across strains.  This cross-strain homogeneity is most pronounced for the vaccinated subjects.  \\n\\nPerhaps the bad news is that, similar to prior studies from the La Jolla group, there is considerable heterogeneity between subjects.  As shown in figure 3, if you had weaker IFNg production to wild-type, you also had weak production to the 4 other strains.  This could be due many differences between subjects including differences in hla class I and II binding of the peptides based on HLA allele.. Early reports suggested the Moderna vaccine didn\\'t stimulate much of a CD8+ T cell response (unlike PFizers). Does this paper indicate this is inconsequential?. 73% of the donors were female and they were all between the ages of 21 and 57. Would we anticipate seeing different results in an older population, more males, or those that are immunocompromised?  This demographic (female adults of reproductive age) has generally been the least severely impacted/least likely to develop severe Covid out of all demographic groups of adults.. What about vaccines that don‚Äôt actually induce T cell responses, like the few inactivated virus vaccines we have being rolled out in some countries (Sinovac‚Äôs in Brazil, for example)?.

ABSTRACT \\n\\nThe spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike pro- teins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multi- ple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human an- giotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combina- tion thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE \\n\\nA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.. **Reminder:** This post contains a **preprint** that has **not been peer-reviewed.**\\n\\nReaders should be aware that preprints have not been finalized by authors, may contain errors, and report info that has **not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.**\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Abstract\\n\\nCOVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1‚Äì8. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‚Äúexoproteome‚Äù). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.\\n\\nHumoral immunity plays dichotomous roles in COVID-19. Although neutralizing antibodies afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection9,10, growing evidence suggests that dysregulated humoral immunity also contributes to the characteristic immunopathology of COVID-1911‚Äì17. For example, subsets of COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit an expansion of pathological extrafollicular B cell populations (IgD- /CD27- double negative, DN) that have been associated with autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients12,18. Furthermore, recent reports have identified isolated autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 patients, including those that are characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor (anti-IgG-Fc antibodies), antiphospholipid antibodies, and antibodies against type 1 interferons (IFN-I)15‚Äì17. Importantly, some autoantibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies against IFN-I, appear to directly contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology by antagonizing innate antiviral responses11. While striking examples of disease-modifying autoantibody responses have been described, the full breadth of autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 and their immunological and clinical impacts remain undetermined at a proteome-scale. We therefore sought to identify functional autoantibody responses in COVID-19 patients by screening for autoantibody reactivities against the human exoproteome (the set of extracellular and secreted proteins in the proteome)..

Covid\\'s days are numbered - the human race is coming for you !!. Yes we are. THANK YOU for this post!  My second Moderna shot is scheduled for March 27 and I\\'m already stressing about it.   It\\'s good to hear that your side effects were so mild.. I‚Äôm going for my first tomorrow and having so much anxiety. Reading this really helped.. Similar age-36- and almost identical side effects! Glad I\\'m fully vaccinated now. It didn\\'t mess with my cycle the first time either.. 34-M getting my first dose today. Thank you for posting. The horror stories on here have really been worrying me that last few days.. Don‚Äôt let the bad posts deter you!  You will probably have some mild side effects, but it honestly felt like I had too much to drink the night before.  Stretch your arm after (and frequently), it‚Äôll help keep the pain away at the injection site. I did a long yoga session after, and I think it helped with the arm pain and my anxiety.. Same. A+ typing. Take D and C every day. My partner drinks beer like it\\'s water. He really struggled with the second dose. I could see my body battling the virus on my watch (stress level and resting heart rate). Other than seeing watch data on a screen, I would not have known any difference.. Studies are indicating that the Pfizer vaccine produces strong immunization response after just one dose.  This has led many to question whether a second dose is even necessary - especially since we are racing to vaccinate as many people as possible.  However, the emergence of variants, particularly from South Africa and Brazil, has thrown a wrench into everything.  Studies are showing that postponing the second dose may leave people less protected against these variant.\\n\\nThere is a lot of great news about vaccines, but there remains a lot of uncertainty.  At the end of the day, beating this pandemic is more about the population getting vaccinated than individuals getting vaccinated.  So until we reach herd immunity (\\\\~ 70% to 80% immunized), experts recommend we all, vaccinated and unvaccinated, maintain social distancing and masks.. That‚Äôs how I felt.  I think the second dose really solidifies the immune system for the ‚Äúlong haul‚Äù. I\\'d wait until 2 weeks after your second dose mostly because that\\'s when your antibody presence is likely to be sufficient to actually neutralize an infection, meaning the likelihood of you spreading the virus will reduce substantially. A little extra time could save someone\\'s life.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget that you should remain extremely vigilant around people who are unvaccinated because you can potentially spread the virus to them while you remain completely asymptomatic.. Personally I got the second dose and am following the science. If I couldn‚Äôt get the second dose okay probably.  The second dose is a very freeing experience.\\nI‚Äôve done what I should.. I think it\\'s three weeks until it properly kicks in. The second is really just to ensure it lasts longer.. I got my first Pfizer shot last night. The only side effect I have is a mild sore arm.. 23M - was it your first dose? Literally the same experience where I awoke during the night after receiving my first Moderna dosage earlier that afternoon. Same symptoms as you had described and yes, Tylenol did provide relief. My arm was sore for 3-4 days and the systematic side effects disappeared on the evening of day 2. Hang in there!. My effect was the opposite, I could smell all kinds of things I normally couldn‚Äôt... it went away by the time I woke up this morning. üò¢. that\\'s so weird you say that! today i was out for a walk with friends and swore I smelled this like... banana-gasoline combo. It wasn\\'t even bad. I asked them if they also smelled it... apparently just me. weird stuff. Not a DR but a healthcare worker. blood pressure can fluxuate. Its slightly elevated but but it\\'s not something i would be concerned with. If it gets to the 130s or keeps increasing id call your primary. I believe the higher hundreds for your systolic is a hypertensive emergency. \\n\\n\\nIncreased heart rate is also a side effect of the vaccine AND your anxiety. Try deep breathing exercises and such. If you\\'re feeling short of breath, new chest pain, weakness then its an emergency room trip. Being in the 80s while resting is fast but i wouldn\\'t think of it as an emergency unless you had those other symptoms with it. Anxiety can definitely make you tachy.\\n\\nif it concerns you I\\'d call your primary and they can direct you from a much more knowledgeable position.\\n\\nEdit: remember you did get the vaccine and will be having side effects from it like nausea, ect.\\n\\n2nd edit: saw it went up and went back down. Miss read. If it goes back up id say call your primary and talk about it but it could be stress related.. I‚Äôm sorry this has happened to you and thank you for sharing. Don‚Äôt have advice to give, but do have a question- have you had issues with BP in the past? I‚Äôm asking bc and wondered how you‚Äôre monitoring it. Do you have a BP monitor at home?\\nI don‚Äôt and was also wondering if I should get one for possible side effects measuring before I get the vaccine. I would have no way of knowing what my BP levels are. Is it worth the $30 if I haven‚Äôt had BP issues before?. I\\'ve never had BP issues; I have anxiety, though, and a specific, bizarre anxiety (extra bizarre given that I\\'ve always had normal BP) about having a heart attack or a stroke. I recently was put on Wellbutrin to treat my ADHD, and I found that it increased my anxiety and I ended up buying a BP monitor on Amazon out of anxiety and a constant desire to make sure it was still normal (which it was prior to the second dose of Covid). For me, the peace of mind is worth the cost because it helps me with my Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that I use to treat the anxiety.. huh, as someone with seasonal allergies, this is definitely of interest to me... i hope you get it figured out! i haven\\'t gotten the vaccine yet so i don\\'t have a comparison experience for you unfortunately, do you take daily medication for your allergies?. Just over the counter antihistamines. Only one every once in a while, three today! Probably just a minor side effect which will pass like the others. The doldrums fatigue was the worst part, aching knees and zero energy. But regardless of those small discomforts, I feel very privileged to have had a vaccine at a young 46.. I was just about to make a post, and honestly I probably still will.\\n\\nMy first dose was on Tuesday, 2/23. That afternoon was nothing special, some arm soreness. \\n\\nThe next day I was pretty sick, headache, queasy, and my arm was very sore. Then Thursday, Friday, and Saturday everything was completely fine. Saturday night I woke up to my chest really hurting, my assumption is acid reflux, my period coming early, and some anxiety. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep for the rest of the night. \\n\\nSunday things were okay, still some weird acid reflux feelings. Monday the chest pain more pronounced and I that‚Äôs when I got the body aches as well. \\n\\nLast night I got a migraine and went to sleep early. Today has been a very slight headache, the upset stomach, my arm is weirdly starting to tingle and my jaw has gotten super tight in the last couple of hours. I have no clue what‚Äôs going on, but I did have 3 days with no discernible symptoms and there has been a new development everyday since. I really have no clue at what point to reach out to a doctor or to just let ride. Needless to say I‚Äôm super nervous for my second dose.. I‚Äôm on the iud and after my second dose I started spotting. Never had a period or spotting in the 9 months I‚Äôve been on the iud.. I got Moderna (2nd dose on 2/11).  I have an IUD and have rarely ever spotted but now am having significant spotting as well as headaches and cramping.. Yes! It had an effect on mine, too. I got the vaccine on feb. 15 and started spotting two days later. I spotted for 11 days before I finally got my actual period (yesterday!). My period was about a week late. It\\'s been heavier and crampier than normal, and I\\'ve been irritable, slightly nauseous and lost my appetite, all of which isn\\'t normal for me. I usually feel good on my period, and usually just have light cramping on the first day that I dont need pain relief for, and no mood or any other changes. I am not on birth control.. Just to add ‚Äî my period always goes wonky after having a pretty significant illness.\\n\\nSince your body is reacting to what it thinks is the virus, this is not only surprising, I should think it‚Äôs kinda expected.  \\n\\n(Not a doc, just speaking from personal experience from pneumonia and shingles). Does anyone know exaclty why it does that. Thanks for talking about this. I actually reported my concerning change in menstrual cycles to VARES. I\\'m also not a conspiracy theorist, just want to add to the research!. I had both doses of moderna, typically in regular enough to set a clock by. No change to the cycle - still regular.. I got my second Pfizer on 1/25. Birth control means my periods are usually very short and light. I bled for 2 weeks. And skipped my most recent one.. I am SO happy to see this thread!! I am late perimenopausal and therefore, irregular is the new normal, BUT... after having light to medium infrequent periods and intermittent spotting for a over a year, I had the heaviest period of my ENTIRE LIFE this time (first one post vaccines). I was actually kind of freaked out and like someone else said, it wiped me out for 3 days. It started on 2/23. My second dose was 2/11.. Funny enough, I got pregnant between my first and second shots. I know it‚Äôs not due to the vaccine, but it‚Äôs fun to think about it. (I wanted to be, so it‚Äôs all good). I was 3 days early after receiving the 2nd Pfizer vaccine,  but cramping wasn\\'t nearly as bad. However, I did just get a new female coworker,  and my cycle will usually change when I\\'m around new women. So I don\\'t know if it was the vaccination,  the new lady,  or both. Sorry my input sucks,  but I feel like you make a good point,  with body stress potentially leading to a change in cycle.. Caution tmi:\\n\\nHi. Astra Zeneca/oxford first shot 27th, 2 days later some very light pink colouring on tissue. (Looked very much like implantation bleeding) I never ever spot, never see anything other than normal come out of me except for actual menstruation time. I‚Äôm bang on every 26 days for 5-7 days. Never anything in between. Absolutely perfect predictable cycles. Haven‚Äôt been on any form of contraception for 14 years. \\nYet this light pink spotting, (not spots though rather jelly that expanded to two tissues and only upon wipe) \\nNow I have mild cramping today day 3. \\nI am still 7 days before aunt flow. \\nAbsolutely odd for me.. Just to add my experience (30F, haven\\'t had Covid), my period came on time after my 1st dose of Pfizer. I had my 2nd dose on February 13th, so I have yet to see if my period will be on time after the 2nd but I was relieved to see that it was normal after my first dose.. Good post! My period was also late after my first dose of the Pfizer. Definitely was slightly concerning, but I\\'m gonna assume it\\'s my immune system working hard! 100% would do it again.. I got the first shot (moderna) a few weeks ago and I haven\\'t noticed any difference. I\\'ll keep an eye out for it after my second.. Thank you so much for posting this. My period was late to begin with, then I got my vaxx and it stopped entirely (granted, that was only two days ago, but still). This made me feel much better.. I‚Äôm perimenopausal and had my first shot 1/4 and second on 2/4. My period has been a big weirdo for about 5 years now (twice it went away completely for 11 months and returned) and sometimes my periods are light and spotty, sometimes heavy. But I‚Äôve been spotting daily for 2 months now and it‚Äôs a brand new pattern for me.  This makes soooo much sense to me now.  Makes me feel better that this is probably why. I was planning on talking to my doctor (which I should probably do anyway).. I don\\'t understand. Many of you have experienced menstrual problems like OP, and most of your responses are of relief!! WTF! This is a serious effect, if so many women are experiencing similar menstrual problems. What affect will this have on fertility or the ability to reproduce? The fact is, no one knows the long term effects. Scary. &gt; Getting the vaccine is certainly a privilege.\\n\\nWtf. Background: I get my period monthly +/- 1-2 days.\\n\\nCommenting to just say that I am still regular with my period. After the first dose my period was heavy and ended sooner than usual. However this happens once in a blue moon for me anyways so I didn\\'t think much of it. After the second dose my period was still normal.. I had some changes to my menstrual cycle too! I was on day 2 of my period when I got the first dose of Pfizer, and the day after I experienced way heavier than normal bleeding that lasted two days. It was like my body went into overdrive and let the rest of the cycles bleeding go at once.. I know that one news outlet reported that Israel health ministry was going to review a few reports about a change in some women\\'s menstrual cycles. I hope a health professional will explain that it\\'s a normal side effect to the public so it doesn\\'t scare some people from getting the vaccine. I spotted a week after my first Pfizer dose. \\nBut my period is literally affected by everything. \\nJust going off  of what OP is saying, after I had mono my period was 2 months late. \\nIt\\'s your body\\'s way of saying \"hey we just spent a lot of energy on this immune response, let\\'s hold off until we know the coast is clear\"\\nThat\\'s my very scholarly way of explaining it.\\n\\nAlso I started ovulating 2 days ago! That means my period is probably only going to be about a week late.. Identical experience, even got the vaccine on the 16th and my period just came today. We‚Äôre .... ~nsync~ üò≥. Surprise! Surprise!. This makes so much sense now!! I got my first dose of Pfizer in early feb and my period was so irregular the last few weeks! I bled for nearly two weeks when I usually bleed for less than one.. Yep! I had dose 1 of moderna on 2/16 and mine came two days later, which was 3 days early. I have mirena IUD.. No effect after first dose. But also no side effects. Period arrived right on time.  Second dose knocked me out so we shall see in a week.. I got the Pfizer and got my period a week early !. Mine was 3 weeks late after the second vaccine!. Very thankful for this post and thread! I\\'ll keep this in mind when I get vaccinated now that I\\'m in the clear to get it, and being a person with an IUD!. I had the first dose of Moderna and no unusual menstrual changes! I get my second dose Saturday and I will report back somewhere somehow if I‚Äôm late on my period as a result. I got moderna 1st and 2nd dose. After 1st dose my period was only like 2 days late. Just had my period on time today. I was wondering where it went. Thanks for this!. I got Astrazeneca. My period is normal.. received pfizer last wednesday. got my period over the weekend and now i‚Äôm on the fourth day of active pills and it‚Äôs still heavy with no end in sight. very unusual for me.. Didn\\'t affect mine at all. I hope this helps ease some worries.. I had my second shot of Moderna on 2/2. It didn‚Äôt impact my cycle in any way AT ALL. I‚Äôm also TTC and had positive OPKs last month. \\nFor those worried-don‚Äôt let this scare you!! \\nAnd op maybe use language like ‚Äúcan impact your period‚Äù and not something so alarmist.. I can‚Äôt edit the title but I edited the post itself so it doesn‚Äôt come off as alarmist. Thanks! My intention is not to alarm or scare anyone from getting the vaccine. Simply just a personal observation of short term side effects.. I had stomach trouble and nausea with the Oxfotd-AZ. So pretty standard.. I had nausea and diarrhea on day 2-3 post Moderna vaccine but it was tolerable. I just stayed very hydrated, drank ginger ale and ate crackers or carbs when I‚Äôd get the waves of nausea on and off through those 2 days. It subsided and was never to the level of stomach bug though.. I had some mild diarrhea after the first Moderna, too. And loss of appetite after the second one (had it on Sunday and still not very hungry today, Wednesday).. I slept for a while and woke up with no digestive issues. Now just feeling exhausted.. I came here ready to tell the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to get fucked, but that was a surprisingly rational and measured statement.  Regardless, any \"abortion-derived cell lines\" which might be used in the production of this virus does nothing to change the fact that these fetus\\' were already aborted.  Might as well make it count for something.\\n\\nFor my part, I would consider the death of a postnatal person due to Covid-19 the greater tragedy, particularly in light of the fact that we now have vaccines.  If you object to the J&amp;J vaccine on moral grounds and have the option to get an alternative vaccine, please do.  If, however, your only option is the J&amp;J vaccine, please take it.  You have a greater moral obligation to the living than to the dead/never born.. Isn\\'t that the Guiness logo ?. I think you\\'re right about the importance of getting vaccinated one way or the other.  And that seems to be what the Conference was saying as well.  Beyond the ethical issues (which are a story in their own right), the bigger story to me is how this highlights the real confusion that exists over the multiple available vaccines.  And we should expect maybe two or more vaccines to be coming out somewhat soon (AstraZeneca and Novavax).  I\\'m concerned that not confronting this confusion and not having a national dialogue about choosing among the vaccine options may lead to mass hesitancy when vaccines are finally widely available.. God save the queen. I love that she had a sparkly cold shoulder top for the occasion.. Maybe help convince some rednecks that this isn‚Äôt some giant Bill Gates scheme. I‚Äôm 33 but I qualify only because I had a stroke in July (thanks2020) and live in a nursing home and rehab facility to recover from the stroke.  So if I can get the vaccine, I definitely think Dolly should get it-she‚Äôs a National Treasure and deserves it way more than I do, good for Dolly, I was a little worried because she didn‚Äôt seem to want to get it yet because she felt that she‚Äôd be cutting in line but honestly, I would have put her first.. &gt; The star posted a cheeky caption with the snap, writing ‚ÄúDolly gets a dose of her own medicine.‚Äù The message is a nod to Parton‚Äôs generous contribution of $1 million that went towards the research of the new Moderna vaccine.\\n\\nNice. :D :D :D. Quick tip: if you haven\\'t listened to the podcast \\'Dolly Parton\\'s America\\'s do it now! Dr. Abumrad, giving her the vaccine, is the podcaster\\'s father and their story of friendship is beautiful. \\n\\n\\nhttps://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america. This even makes a no-good California transplant like myself feel better about gettin‚Äô the ol‚Äô jab. She should have been one of the first people in line. National treasures have priority.. Nice!. VA has it but I being one that cannot remember the last time I got sick or even having a headache (strong immune system) with no underlying illnesses opted out for now.  Letting those in need more get it for now.. Is there more of one kind of vaccine in Nashville, or is it pretty much equal? I got the Pfizer last week, Dolly got Moderna. Anyone else here been vaccinated...and which one did you get?. Fun fact: dolly wears a new pair of pajamas every night and throws each pair away afterwards.. She‚Äôs great, she‚Äôs a really nice person, but why do you guys worship her? She‚Äôs just a person. Well, in this specific instance, she donated $1 Million to help develop this vaccine, so that\\'s awesome. Not only that, she\\'s one of the nicest, most supportive/charitable celebrities. She has also been one of the most respected voices in Country Music that has been on the more progressive side of social issues. Plus, we get to call her our own!. Name a better Tennessean. \\n\\n\\nShe does so much good for the community, provides a lot to charity, provided money to support vaccine research, she isn\\'t a dick, and she sends free books to kids every month because it is good for them.. In a time when we have a reason to cancel almost anyone, it‚Äôs hard to find fault in Dolly Parton. \\n\\nShe is one of the exceedingly few people in American life without controversy despite being adored. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt know who even comes close‚Äîmaybe 90s Oprah?. Dont know why the downvotes. you just asked a legit question.\\n\\nDolly has done a lot of for the local community. She is an advocate to children\\'s education, provided money to vaccine research, and is by all accounts a good person. that she is also a talented musician just put her in the spotlight. that fame afforded her the money to and time to put some of it back into the community.. Look, this is all terrible but thank god these two people had Naloxone on hand.\\n\\nAlso, how does one have Naloxone on hand?. You can get it at pharmacies, no questions asked. Your insurance may or may not pay for it. [https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2016/09/12/tn-makes-naloxone-available-without-rx/91065914/](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2016/09/12/tn-makes-naloxone-available-without-rx/91065914/). The Nashville Prevention Partnership will also come to any office or workplace and train groups on how to administer and provide free doses.  They‚Äôre a wonderful group to work with but I‚Äôm not sure how covid has impacted their groups.. One official article I\\'ve found on this: https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2021/03/02/watch-tennessee-state-health-leaders-giving-update-shelby-county-vaccine-investigation-johnson-johnson-vaccine/?fbclid=IwAR3pjUeaSq4Tl7flTLPxAOw6MwCg40ZvFbspwXxYEBND4QpDJMWfFybSIqs. Great news!  I may have to drive a couple of counties away to get a shot, but I will happily do it.. &gt; **Does a person need a note from their health care provider to prove they are high risk and eligible for Phase 1C?**\\n\\n&gt; No, a note is not required to prove that an individual is eligible to be vaccinated in the Phase 1C population.\\n\\n[FAQ](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/COVID-19_Vaccine_Provider_FAQs.pdf). 62 and still waiting.  I guess that I‚Äôm healthy is a blessing.  But still want life to return to some semblance of normal.. Oh thank fuck.. Interestingly enough,  if you look at Walmart\\'s website for neighboring counties,  they do have plenty of appointments available for people who already qualify.  \\n\\nBut I\\'m seeing a ton of people saying they can\\'t get an appointment.  I don\\'t think you need to stay within your own county.. Can anyone venture an educated guess on when the 55+ age group will be able to get the jab?. If you\\'re in 1C you can make an appointment in Clarksville now: [https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d4daea628a5f4c43-first](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0d4daea628a5f4c43-first). In the last year and a half I\\'ve lost 80 pounds yet I\\'m still 3 points over the number to be considered obese (33.7 vs anything over 30 is considered obese) I may just eat a lot of pizza this week to not fuck this up.. Are we going to keep dividing the incoming vaccine supply among counties the same way we initially did? It would make more sense to throttle back in places sitting on supply and divert supply to places with greater demand and no stockpiles.. Finally! Fat people unite LOL!\\n\\nSpeaking of, does anyone know if you can for sure get vaccinated in a county you don‚Äôt live in? Sounds like Davidson isn‚Äôt proceeding to 1C yet. Does that mean we can book appointments for next week already at pharmacies or do we need to wait until next week to book the 1C appointments?. Story is up now.\\n\\nhttps://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2021/03/02/tennessee-move-next-coronavirus-vaccine-phase-1-c-part-due-lack-demand/6891392002/. FYI for anyone looking for a location with open appointments, there are several spots available tomorrow and the next day at Volunteer State in Gallatin (Sumner County).. Does anyone know how they are going to verify comorbidities? Like, will you be measured and weighed for BMI on site?. Full report to come later this afternoon, but alas! Progress!. \"lack of demand\".....\\n\\nI find that unbelievable .... J&amp;J?. Sweet baby jesus!. Big fucking sigh of relief.. So, if there are pharmacies booking for Monday and Tuesday, could we book an appointment for them as long as it\\'s not one of the six counties with their own health department directives...?\\n\\nFor instance, like Walmart and Walgreens. They are booking into next week already.. Great!  \\nLets hope all the antivaxxers wake up and join the rest of the team.  \\nWe need everyone in on this so we can do things like go to concerts, go bowling..... So if your a smoker or obese you get the vaccine first.  Guess I made the wrong life choices.. I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true, unless you‚Äôre just giving your personal opinion: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/wondering-about-covid-19-vaccines-if-youre-pregnant-or-breastfeeding-2021010721722.

If you want a deeper dive, I\\'m keeping the data for it here: https://github.com/VecGS/tn-covid19-data/. We know someone in the ICU on vent, so that really sucks.\\n\\nBut DAD GOT HIS FIRST DOSE OF THE VACCINE TODAY YESSSSSSSSSSSS. Now to try to get Mom hers!!!!!. I got vaccinated yesterday...now I have to wait out the next few weeks until I build immunity. With my luck, I will have gone from April last year to March this year, and two weeks before the amazing life-saving vaccine kicks in, I\\'ll get it.\\n\\nIt\\'s at least good to know that the stats show it will be \"somewhat\" easier to avoid in the next few weeks. \\n\\nGlad I don\\'t live in Texas, though.... Amazing. The WHO changed the testing guidelines, specifically around BS PCR tests. For this reason,  cases plummet and we‚Äôre told things are improving. All that‚Äôs happened is that cases are no longer being artificially inflated. Nothing has changed. The virus is no more/less deadly and no more/less contagious than it was in Q1 2020. Well, at least we will be allowed to have some of our freedom back‚Ä¶I hope.\\n\\nEdit: grammar and spelling.. What about hospitalizations?  They change that too?.  \"Gov. Ron DeSantis quietly expanded COVID-19 vaccine eligibility late last week to allow Floridians younger than 65 who have high-risk medical conditions to get the injections at doctors‚Äô offices and pharmacies .\"\\n\\nWHY quietly, he never does anything good quietly!. We definitely need more details about the requirements and who is offering what.  Right now it isn\\'t very useful.. Cool can we get essential workers in next?. Just checked Publix and their website says eligibility is based off the states website and the states website isn‚Äôt updated and still says only hospitals can do it ugh. Some pharmacies may have already started to do this. My mom is 63 and has several preexisting conditions. She had called around to Walmart pharmacies and placed her name on the list for leftover vaccines. After less than a week, they called her on Friday and scheduled her for an actual appointment. She received her vaccination on Saturday morning.. I don\\'t have insurance but have a couple different comorbidities. How do I get a doctor\\'s note? Can I call a doctor I haven\\'t seen in a few years? I mean I used to see a rheumatologist here but she quit right before I lost coverage, i think her office might still have my records though? I don\\'t know what to do here. Any ideas?. I received an email last night from my hospital, I\\'m in a bariatric weight loss program, saying I was eligible. I was confused but schedule the appointment. I\\'m only in my 30s but high risk, obese and some heart stuff, so im very grateful. I was worried it was a mistake and they were going to call me and cancel the appointment. But I think this means it\\'s real.. It would be fucking great if someone could let Publix know the rules changed. I just got a call that I don‚Äôt qualify for the appointment I somehow managed to get this morning because I‚Äôm not 65+. I let them know the rules changed and that I had a signed letter from my Doctor. The next barrier was that it needed to be the specific DOH form. Only after my confirmation that I had THAT specific form signed did they run my insurance and let me know I could come in for my appointment. This entire process is a fucking wreck, from the seemingly endless number of web browsers open to get a chance at applying for an appointment to having to defend WHY I need a fucking vaccine from some snotty Pharmacist that thinks my age is funny. Fuck you Publix. Fuck you Deathsantis, you gross slimy fuckfaced prick. Never in my life did I think I would have to beg to get a fucking vaccine. /rant. Friday night I got an email from my health provider that I was able to sign up for a shot. I signed up and have my appointment March 3rd. I was suspicious it might have been a scam because it was so easy and untill I saw this post I had not heard that I was allowed to get the shot.. I was able to get my friend who has pre-existing conditions an appt at Publix for Thurs. Thoughts on whether she should call and confirm that this is ok before she shows up? What should she bring as \\'proof\\'?. Yet pharmacies won‚Äôt allow you make an appointment if you‚Äôre under 65.. I called my physician and got a letter recommending I get a vaccine because I have several conditions. How do I go about scheduling? The pharmacies don‚Äôt yet have an option for under 65. I know the hospital near me is doing the vaccines with recommendations. Do I call them and request it?. My wife should qualify, but since we just moved to Florida we can\\'t get a note from her previous PCP (insurance has changed so our old insurance won\\'t do anything but give us our medical records). We also can\\'t get in with a new PCP until late March/early April. Are there any online or walk-in clincs we could try? We snagged Winn-Dixie appointments for later this week, but are afraid that just medical history print-outs won\\'t be sufficient.. I booked an appointment earlier in the morning through the publix website for my mother who is 62 and has heart and diabetic issues. Her PCP gave her a doctor\\'s note as well, although I\\'m hearing people say that their appointments are getting canceled if they\\'re under 65 via Publix. It\\'s all so confusing.. I live in Brevard County, and I called the Health Department vaccine line to check on this and they said they are not yet accepting people for a vaccine for high-risk people.. So it says psychicans under chapter 458 an 459 , this can mean anyone licensed in the state . im calling my psychtrist , primary , an pain doctor tomorrow one of them will write me a note  that i need it call all your doctors one should write you one if you fall under cdc guidelines !. According to one article he did it because he *thinks* we are going to get a J+J shipment soon. That doesn\\'t sound right to me because I\\'ve been seing reports for weeks that J+J is delayed. It sounds like he might have done it to distract from his wealthy zip code flap.\\n\\nFrom a practical standpoint I think we should still focus on 65 and up. The media has been going out of their way to highlight younger people who catch it, and I don\\'t minimize their suffering at all but they really are the minority of cases. If our goal is to prevent deaths and reduce strain on hospitals then we need to get more seniors vaccinated.. Does the doctor have to be licensed in Florida?. It would be nice if the over 65 were vaccinated first, since that is where most of the deaths occur.  In other words, statistically many more elders die.. I\\'m 75 and I\\'m not taking it. This is not new. My local hospital started doing this in February when the state said some vaccine could be allocated to high risk..

This is the way.. I can‚Äôt find the actual way to get an appointment for a Covid vaccine on CVS after reading this‚Ä¶ Anyone have any luck?. Yay, CVS!. De Santis is a jackass.   He\\'s a Trump wannabe.   I\\'m glad Biden is following common sense here.. This made me cry.. I wish  someone in the white house would  look into him. Someone needs to help everyone in florida not just people who are rich and follow his politics. Hopefully the lower class Republicans realize he doesn\\'t care about them either.  They cant give to his reelection.. Ron DeSantis for President.. Common sense says you can open it up to everyone but that just creates a clusterf**k of people trying to get appts and people getting angrier. 50+, immuno compromised makes sense - the people most likely to die or not be able to fight the virus. No one is trying to not give the vaccine but everyone going to get it at the same time just leads to grumbling, frustration. For me, I\\'ll get it when it\\'s my turn and not take it away from.people who truly need it more.. Some teachers are \"zooming\", some kids by their family choice are \"zoomin\", some have gone to virtual school, also their choice. Not every teacher had to go back. Why dont you find out the facts first. Every teacher I know in FL is in person.. In two dozen cities across Florida, the CVS Pharmacy chain is vaccinating teachers under age 50, circumventing state orders that continue to limit coronavirus inoculations to those over that age.\\n\\nCVS said it is following Biden administration guidelines released this week, which are broader for educators than Florida‚Äôs. For teachers, Florida limits the vaccine to classroom teachers 50 and older who work in kindergarten through 12th grade. The federal guidelines allow day care workers, preschool teachers and educators in elementary, middle and high schools to be vaccinated with no age limit.\\n\\nThe governor‚Äôs press office declined to comment.\\n\\n[Read the report](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/04/cvs-offering-virus-vaccine-to-florida-teachers-under-50/). Does anyone know if CVS updates their available appointments at a specific time?. My son (twenty something Broward teacher) is taking 40 minute drive to CVS in Miami Sunday to get Vaccine. Worth it.. Good on CVS, let\\'s support them even though corporate, they didn\\'t have to do this and risk the wrath of DeathSantis.\\n\\nFinally some sanity in Florida. Renews hope for 2021. Glad to see CVS stepping up in leadership and doing what DeSantis isn\\'t.. Yeah, because the state has done so poorly compared to other states.. Republicans are the perfect example of white rich supremacy. Fuck the poor person but let‚Äôs vaccinate the rich. Hope the people of Florida remember the governors action along with Trump.. \\nI know some of those people, good for them, they got to play golf and tennis...even go to dinner parties.. while the rest of us are sitting here going to work everyday, in rooms with many people in them. These people do not work and live in huge homes on the water, just think about how crazy they would have gone if they had to have food delivered everyday while sitting in their hot tubs! \\n\\nIsn\\'t DeSantis the best?. Coincidentally, DeSantis‚Äô PAC raised $2.7 million last month, its largest amount ever. The sad part is many of the poor sit there and agree with what\\'s going on here. It\\'s crazy.. Given how the vaccination information has been changing so rapidly of late, should there maybe be a pinned thread dedicated to up to date information? Like:\\n\\nWho is offering appointments &amp; when do they open?\\nWho is eligible at each?\\nAny other requirements or FAQ?\\n\\nJust a suggestion. My SO\\'s doctor\\'s office said they won\\'t fill this form for their patients. The doctor specializes in diabetes and that\\'s what my SO sees him for. What medical history would be needed? Would medication prescriptions work? Prescription for hba1c? I want them to get the vaccine but we don\\'t live near a FEMA site and will have to make an appointment at the pharmacy.. So, if you are under 65, medically vulnerable and have this form, you can go to a FEMA site? I heard that this form only works at pharmacies and retailers.. /u/dictate_this, thank you for all you are doing! I\\'ve seen your name across FL threads like a dozen times per day now. Have you heard of any successful requests for healthy parents/caretakers of \\'extremely vulnerable\\' children being approved to get vaccinated? Or discussion on when this group will be added next? It is unlikely the vaccine will be approved for kids under 8, especially vulnerable kids under 8, until 2022. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been locked up for a full year now, haven\\'t been anywhere besides home for nearly 365 days to keep our kids safe. It would be nice knowing we are protected as another layer of protection for our kids!. I\\'m a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\\n\\n- [/r/orlando] [\\\\[X-Post\\\\] Rep.

Hey there! Happy to help!\\n\\nUnfortunately no news for this specific group yet. I know that‚Äôs most likely not what you wanted to hear but supply is increasing greatly so hopefully in a few weeks I will have some better news for you!. &gt;The CVS Pharmacy chain is vaccinating Florida teachers under age 50, circumventing state orders that continue to limit coronavirus inoculations to those over that age.\\n\\n&gt;The chain also began vaccinating daycare and preschool teachers Wednesday, even though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has not yet opened the vaccination program to them. CVS is giving inoculations in two dozen cities across the state.\\n\\n&gt;CVS said it is following Biden administration guidelines released this week, which are broader for educators than Florida‚Äôs. For teachers, Florida limits the vaccine to classroom teachers 50 and older who work in kindergarten through 12th grade. The federal guidelines allow daycare workers, preschool teachers, and educators in elementary, middle, and high schools to be vaccinated with no age limit. Never thought I\\'d be applauding CVS for their leadership in this crisis, but bravo! Organizations and individuals taking initative and being bold is how we get this done when our system has failed us.. All appointments are full in the entire state. Even if it says they have some, they don\\'t. Thanks for the glimmer of hope. Back to feeling left out in the cold Oh well.\\n\\nKudos to CVS for giving the desantis idiot in charge a big middle finger as they should. The guy is the worst..

[Here are the facts.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/04/one-year-in-how-does-covid-19s-toll-compare-with-other-causes-of-death/). No appointment required, but limited only to certain groups right?. You have to go and see , they said on the news you might be eligible. There is also one in progress village. I read an article that said only those eligible are able to get vaccinated currently. The form now exists. It was published at 10:59 PM the night before it‚Äôs supposed to be used.\\n\\n**WHAT WE KNOW**\\n\\n1. This is beyond infuriating.\\n2. If you have an appt at Publix Wed/Thurs with a doctor‚Äôs note, you should be fine without the note.\\n3. IF THEY TURN YOU AWAY, DM ME\\n\\n**WHAT WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW**\\n\\n**Q** What happens for this who are booking appts for Friday/Saturday? Can I just use my doctor‚Äôs note? That took weeks to get and my doc won‚Äôt quickly return this form instead.\\n\\n**A** We don‚Äôt know. But we really encourage you to go to that appointment with the doctor\\'s note. [YOU ARE GETTING THAT SHOT.](https://twitter.com/CarlosGSmith/status/1367101351839338497?s=20)\\n\\n**RANT**\\n\\nIf one can afford to pay the doctor again, to have the doctor sign this form, their chances are better. But people have already been collecting doc‚Äôs notes for months! This form is unnecessary red tape which continues to affect our lower income neighbors.\\n\\nBetween this form, and the language that makes it so FEMA sites can‚Äôt vaccinate med vulnerable since they‚Äôre only staffed w/ CNAs and RNs, makes it pretty clear:\\n\\nEO21-47 was intentionally designed with obstacles to unnecessarily continue to limit vaccine access to our med vulnerable neighbors.\\n\\nWe will not stop fighting for you.. I wonder if people with docs that use telehealth or have an online message portal could just send a message and ask for the form? They‚Äôd probably charge to fill it out though :/. From a doctor\\'s perspective, this is equally frustrating. My office literally created a note for all of our patients, our policy was that if you had been seen in the last 6 months that you would get a note without needing to do another visit. then the Florida department of health said that it has to be a specific letter that they created. We are all pissed. It\\'s a fill in the blank form, so even if it takes me only 3 minutes to write, if I\\'m writing 50 of these a day that\\'s over 2 hours of writing notes that I\\'m either doing on my own time, or that I\\'m not able to do visits with my patients with. Please, email the governor and let him know how stupid this all is.. Was there any clarification regarding what actually constitutes ‚Äúextremely vulnerable‚Äù or is that at the discretion of the doctor?. At Publix right now, mom is 62 with conditions and they\\'re on the phone with higher up people. Not sure if this is about her being under 65 but I hope she gets the jab.. florida shows it\\'s stupidity once more.. My doctor refused to write doctor\\'s note for anyone requesting a COVID vaccine.  So they just printed out a summary of my last visit so the Publix employees can diagnose me.  Bullshit.  That is a HIPPA violation at it\\'s finest.  I better get my shot.. You should just be able to bring proof of your condition (something with a diagnostic code on it) like other states instead of a specific form. Tying everything to doctors offices is creating so many barriers to entry for the groups that need the vaccine the most.. I just got a vaccine at publix with a nit from my primary.   51. Aren\\'t we supposed to be making it easier,  not harder, for people to get vaccinated?. How much do you have to donate to the GQP to be extremely vulnerable?. This process is infuriating. I was up at 7 am trying to get an appointment at Publix and all of the appointments closed out at 9 am. I was on the page the whole time and never got an opportunity to make one. Guess I have to be up at 7 am on Friday to try again (not easy for someone with narcolepsy and Hypersomnia). I have an appointment at Winn Dixie on Friday but they don\\'t even say if they\\'re doing under 65 or what they require and their pharmacy won\\'t answer the phone. \\n\\nIt sucks having no way to know if you qualify. I have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, does that qualify as a heart condition? I have narcolepsy, Hypersomnia, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, do any of those qualify as neurological conditions? \\n\\nNo one knows and no one was given preparation or guidance to know, so let\\'s just turn everybody loose to bombard the physicians and pharmacies until somebody figures something out.. I got my vaccine yesterday. I had a doctor‚Äôs note originally, actually several, but I scrambled to get the form. Two of my specialists came through for me. At Publix one woman said I wasn‚Äôt 65+ so I couldn‚Äôt get it, but quickly backed down when I showed her the form. The pharmacist did ask for documentation. I have her the form, but asked what they were accepting and she said it was varied this week because of the mixed messages. Good luck every one!. Any idea if PAs (Physician Assistants) are able to sign these? They can prescribe medicine and everything. My provider is one.. So do I need to ask my Dr to redo my letter recommending me for vaccin then?. This form is so ghetto. Tbh, it\\'s easier to fake than a doctor\\'s note. I doubt they\\'ll even be verifying these. The system is so broken.. To be safest yes see if you can get your dr to fill the official form out. That\\'s good news. I know some people who got appointment at Publix but their jobs gave them a hard time about the short notice. It\\'s crazy high risk people have been working risking their health and yet companies want to be jerks about getting time off to get a vaccine.. My partner got a note today and went straight to the FEMA site. They gave her the vaccine within minutes. That said, they only asked if she HAD a note, but never wanted to see it. She could\\'ve had a napkin and they would have accepted her word for it.. What we know:\\n\\nAPRNs are now staffed at the four FEMA sites. People under 65 deemed ext. vulnerable by a doctor can get vaccinated. They say to bring the signed form that was posted at 11PM last night.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you have a doctor\\'s note, just go. Show up with note. First come, first serve around \\\\~3,000 vaccines at each site.. Just wanted to mention for anyone who sees this and has a Publix appointment...you DO need the form for Publix apparently. They called me today after booking my appointment asking for the form. Maybe each individual spot is different, idk.. Do we know if a PDF copy of the form signed by my doctor is ok? My doctor basically filled it out and emailed it back to me with their signature on it.. Do they have 3k shots a day? Do we need to check before showing up?. My wife is in the extreme high risk category due to an immune disorder. We have a note from her immunologist stating such. We tried to get her signed up through Hillsborough county last week but were turned away and told she wasn‚Äôt eligible because she is under 65. \\n\\nShe is signed up through the Hillsborough county site now but it just stated ‚Äúpre-registered‚Äù and she would be contacted when she is eligible. Any advise on how to push this through and get her vaccinated?  She have her show up to one of the federal sites with her Dr. note?. Show up at a FEMA fed site with the note. Bring the note. Don\\'t have to wait for the form. Bring the note and Go. Go now if you can- open til 7pm.\\n\\n7am-7pm seven days a week. Just Go. Get her vaccinated.\\n\\nWalk ups aren\\'t only accepted- they\\'re ENCOURAGED at the FEMA sites.. Persons 65 and older and 65+ are the exact same things lol. I registered and and put 65 and older but am 25 with health conditions. I called and they said they won‚Äôt turn me away because they hadn‚Äôt added the option to the site yet. I‚Äôm guessing this is a mistake since they‚Äôre the same option twice. Try Publix since they are allowing appointments for 65 and younger with the doctor\\'s note. I\\'m so confused. I registered but when it takes me to the page to make an appointment it says AT THE PRESENT TIME ONLY SENIORS 65 AND OVER CAN SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS.\\n\\nSo can healthcare workers get it or no?. If you click here and pick healthcare worker, it shows you the Orange County Convention Center as an option. \\nhttp://ocfl.net/EmergencySafety/Coronavirus/VaccineInformation.aspx#.YEALupNKhve\\n\\nAdditionally, it says they are registering eligible people at the Convention Center here. Healthcare workers are priority 1a and considered eligible people.  I got vaccinated there myself as part of this group. http://ocfl.net/EmergencySafety/Coronavirus/VaccineInformation/VaccinationSites.aspx#FDOH-OCCC\\n\\nGo ahead and register and take a copy of your driver\\'s license, healthcare license,  and work stub and/or ID badge. Those appointments will book up super quick. Walmart is also vaccinating healthcare workers. They open their appointments late night, so check their website as well.. Walgreens is the latest retail pharmacy chain to begin offering coronavirus vaccines to eligible Floridians in the general population ‚Äî and it appears to be starting with two stores in Pasco County.\\n\\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced vaccines will start Friday at 12028 Majestic Blvd. in Hudson and 6429 Gall Blvd. in Zephyrhills. He said the stores can handle \\\\~80 appointments a day on weekdays and \\\\~60 on weekends. He didn\\'t clarify whether this part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program or a separate state initiative.\\n\\n[Read more](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/03/some-walgreens-stores-now-offering-coronavirus-vaccines-in-florida/). Publix in Tallahassee is literally asking any customer that wants one that they have some available..... after 5pm. Gov. Ron DeSantis held a press conference on Feb. 18 to announce the arrival of 3,000 vaccines for a Pinellas Park senior community. But the process that followed after the cameras were turned off was chaotic and questioned by some.\\n\\nCounty officials were in the dark when DeSantis showed up with the vaccines, and the task of finding 3,000 people to vaccinate on short notice fell to the senior community. Residents and volunteers notified their friends and neighbors. And the complex, which had requested the clinic, was bombarded with phone calls. \\n\\n[Read the full report. ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/03/03/desantis-dropped-off-3000-vaccines-to-a-pinellas-senior-community-but-was-the-distribution-fair/). If I had to guess, seems like more of a photo shoot than an effort to actually vaccinate the community. He absolutely is loving the attention this is drawing to him, and I\\'m sure he loves the power of control of the vaccines he has, its really disturbing.. DeSantis seems to be a complete idiot. Halfwit bullies should be kicked out of politics for good. There‚Äôs nothing strong or masculine about being fully retarded.. Sure it was not he‚Äôs a trump ass kisser. There really needs to be more organization and planning around this.. Walmart  270 Heald Way The Villages will have appointments for 3/10 between 9:40A - 12:40P\\n\\n4085 Wedgewood Ln 3/10 between 9:40A - 5:40 P\\n\\n17961 S Us Highway 441 Summerfield 9:20A - 5:20 P\\n\\nAppointments are released at exactly midnight, check www.time.gov in case your device time is not correct\\n\\nMake sure you have a walmart.com account if you go to https://www.walmart.com/pharmacy/clinical-services/immunization/scheduled?imzType=covid it will ask you to log in or create an account\\n\\nGo back to that page a few minutes before midnight, say 11:58 PM and get logged in with the zip code entered and the map showing the locations.\\n\\nSelect the location you want to make the appointment at and click Continue\\n\\nSelect the eligibility reason and click Confirm\\n\\nIt will show you more information, read it and wait until midnight.

Make sure you have the name exactly as shown on their ID, date of birth, and social security ready to go.. I saw fema sites in Orlando which are walk up no appointments didn‚Äôt have high demand today. Worth a shot to check out a fema site. Hi, can you bring her to Orlando? It is worth it if you get her an appointment.\\n\\nTry and register her right now for an appointment at the Orange County Convention Center drive through site here as appointments still available, but they book up fast:\\nhttps://www.patientportalfl.com/s/?language=en_US. Walmart.com has opened up appointments right now at 12am, go and see if you can get a time slot for your grandmother.. If you‚Äôre not opposed to Walmart, I‚Äôve had to book myself and my mom an appointment and I checked at midnight and had no trouble both times. I set an alarm for 1159pm and then refreshed and booked our appointments.. Try Winn Dixie. I got three appointments my first try on their site. Also Walmart opens appointments at midnight. CVS will be impossible now... they are vaccinating all teachers... against what Desantis order. My experience is with publix. I was also looking in those 3 counties for my parents who live in Marion county. I started trying last month with publix, getting up and logging on about 2 mins before 7am. Monday I was finally able to get through and book appointments. I ended up having to book my mom in Sumter and my dad in lake county, but that was fine with me. You don‚Äôt need to sign up for a publix account to setup an appointment. I also didn‚Äôt have all the information they asked for online (ssn, insurance info), but the pharmacy called them later that day to verify information anyway, so that was fine. \\nOh, and I was on my phone using chrome if that helps!. It\\'s hopeless in FL it seems. :( I\\'ve given up.. For real. I know I personally can\\'t get one right now and probably won\\'t for a while :( but my grandma definitely qualifies and deserves, needs, and wants one. I just hope that with two people trying at least one of us has a chance. Especially with J&amp;J vaccines coming in.. There\\'s another post on this subreddit with the form already. It\\'s located here: http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf. I‚Äôll take it !!. http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf. When I get off work about 3 I‚Äôll email it. Email me at jimhunt81 @ gmail.com and I‚Äôll email back. The only way she would qualify is to get a dr to recommend that she is eligible. I‚Äôm a caretaker for my aunt with dementia, and mom with MS, and I couldn‚Äôt get a recommendation. It sucks, but all we can do is wait unfortunately.. The issue with professional caregivers is they have a lot of patient contact and they are not well paid leading to high turnover. Many refuse vaccines and don\\'t follow safety protocol. The fact you are seeking vaccine and being cautious tells me you are relatively low risk. Probably not what you want to hear but vaccines are coming fast, it won\\'t be long before anyone who wants it can.. Florida officials have shipped 70,000 COVID vaccine doses a week to Publix‚Äôs central distribution hub in Lakeland in Central Florida, without knowing exactly where the shots will go, a *Miami Herald* analysis of state vaccine distribution data from the past five weeks and interviews with state officials found.\\n\\nThe grocery chain ‚Äî a major financial supporter of Gov. Ron DeSantis ‚Äî is the state‚Äôs single-largest vaccine supplier and receives nearly a quarter of Florida‚Äôs available doses without providing state officials a store-specific distribution plan ahead of time, according to Jared Moskowitz, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the agency leading the vaccination campaign.\\n\\n[Read the entire report](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/03/02/publix-gets-1-out-of-4-florida-vaccines-which-officials-dont-track/) from the *Herald* and us.. I work for a competitor and can tell you this is crazy. We have had to account for every single dose of vaccine on a daily basis and the vaccine only gets send to specific locations.. Publix is a Trumpist Corporation.  No wonder DeSantis is giving them un-tracked Vaccines.  This is an easy way for DeSantis and Trump to favor their own voters.\\n\\nDeSantis only cares about his own voters, and Publix is the same.. Does the state track every one who receives the vax in a database or is the card the only proof that it‚Äôs been administered?. Of course...flori duh....land of the stupid people in government...üòÜ. My mom and uncle got their vaccine at Publix last month and this week, no problem.. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*UPDATE::: MEDICALLY VULNERABLE &lt;65 WILL \\\\*\\\\*NOT\\\\*\\\\* BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE AT THE FEMA SITES. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSee [tweet](https://twitter.com/FLSERT/status/1366891077232455683?s=20) here from Florida Division of Emergency Management.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*What we know\\\\*\\\\***\\n\\nEligibility:\\n\\n* 65+\\n* health care workers\\n* school employees 50+\\n* active firefighters 50+\\n* active LEOs 50+\\n\\nAppointments: NOT NECESSARY - \\\\*walk ups accepted\\\\*\\n\\nRecommended, but not necessary.

More to come if this includes the FEMA site next Monday. (We hope!  ü§ûüèº )\\n\\nI am super upset about those medically vulnerable under 65 being left behind again. This is really rough. Need to regroup; I will be back tomorrow with hopefully more information and an update that is better than this [stupid tweet](https://twitter.com/FLSERT/status/1366891077232455683?s=20) I just received, contradictory to what was shared at the press conference at 1pm.. * **K-12 school employees 50 years of ages and older**\\n\\nfinally, some small sanity has arrived in Florida\\n\\nhow about those college professors though. This is really confusing because I am reading that medically vulnerable people can get vaccinated at these sites with a doctors note.. Thank you for the information!. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY AT 1PM MENTIONED PEOPLE BRINGING DOCTOR\\'S NOTES SO THE PRESS RAN WITH THAT AND THEN FL DIVISON OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAME BACK AT 4ISH TONIGHT AND SAID \"NOPE\" (see tweet linked somewhere above) AND NOW I WANT TO CRY.\\n\\nSorry, not yelling at you, just super SUPER frustrated that our medically vulnerable are being left behind AGAIN.. Yes, Vaccines in arms is number one most important. Worrying about who deserves a vaccine first is good but not number one, number one most important thing is vaccines in arms as fast as possible.. &gt; I saw a couple posts yesterday from folks saying that they felt they didn\\'t deserve it as much as essential workers or folks at higher risk.\\n\\nI read some of these as well.  \\n\\nThese people are kind people and they\\'re making a value judgment.  However, what the whole point of Phases 1 and 2 is risk-assessment, not value judgement.  \\n\\nWe\\'re not measuring people based on their past, current, or future contributions to society.  We\\'re prioritizing (Phase 1) our ability to save lives and (Phase 2) the lives of those at greater risk of severe illness or death than average.     Then Phase 3 (everyone else).. I was just telling a friend this, who is eligible but ‚Äúfeels bad‚Äù about going and getting it. Just get it - every vaccinated person gets us closer to the end of this nightmare, and every person who doesn‚Äôt get it slows us down. Right, just get the vaccine if you can get the vaccine. You can still be a moral human being by being vaccinated so you reduce the risk of getting/spreading COVID. Also who gives a shit what other people think about your decisions here? The point is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible.. Another useful perspective, via a friend who works in health care: the faster we can get lots of people vaccinated, the more likely we‚Äôll be able to get control of COVID before we end up with variants that can evade the vaccine and/or are more deadly. It‚Äôs extremely important that as many people as possible get vaccinated as quickly as possible for everyone‚Äôs benefit. Vaccination isn‚Äôt just about the people getting vaccinated, it‚Äôs about creating barriers for diseases so they can‚Äôt spread through communities, which end up protecting everyone. \\n\\nIf you‚Äôre eligible for a vaccine, go get one!!. Thank you. This is just what I needed to hear today.. im torn, im technically eligible for the current vaccines, i have pretty bad asthma and smoke from time to time, but i wont make an appointment until i consistently see available appointment times which hasnt been the case yet. And hopefully it goes without saying for people on this sub (who are overwhelmingly very conscientious and safe, it seems), but continue to take precautions in public even after you\\'re vaccinated and keep wearing your mask. This ain\\'t Texas.. I agree. If I was a benevolent dictator, I would guarantee everyone has a healthcare provider, and then just have the providers contact the patients to schedule appointments based on guidelines.\\n\\nI\\'m not a benevolent dictator, and this isn\\'t the system. I think people should follow the imperfect public health guidelines that we do have, and not try to second guess them. I believe things can be more fair and less fair, but also an perfect hierarchy of fairness is impossible.\\n\\nWe have emerging evidence the vaccines not only stop disease but also *transmission*. Therefore every vaccine in an arm helps protect everyone\\'s health.. Agreed! While I do not medical qualify right now, I accompanied my husband to his first vaccine shot last night. It‚Äôs at a massive facility and I‚Äôve heard sometimes there are leftover doses at the end of the day that they DO NOT want to waste. Unfortunately, they did not have any extras last night for the approximately 10 of us who waited, but I will try again a couple times.. Thank you for posting this. One of my family members is eligible (health issues) and it took some serious convincing to get him to believe he deserves a shot.. This. I was trying to play 4D morality chess but I finally just signed up. I‚Äôm in my 30s. I can run a sub-2 hour half marathon. I can work from home. \\n\\n\\nI also have asthma (and a history of chronic bronchitis) and I‚Äôm exactly 1lb into obese by BMI. I qualify. I secured an appointment within about 30 minutes or deciding that epidemiologists did the work of determining that I‚Äôm worthy of being in this group and I don‚Äôt need to be worried about other ‚Äúmore deserving‚Äù people. \\n\\n\\nI‚Äôm getting shot 1 at Worcester State tomorrow. I don‚Äôt know why I convinced myself to feel bad about it.. Adding onto this, there are fewer people trying to get appointments now then there will be when the general population can get it.  We all hope it will be easier then but it could just be as difficult to schedule appointments if not more so due to numbers.  Getting vaccinated now means not just protecting yourself but protecting everyone you come in contact with. 100% this.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re eligible, get it.\\n\\nLook at the comorbities lists, BMI over 30?, smoker?, etc, get it. Especially if you have a job you have to go to and can\\'t wfh.\\n\\nIt\\'s about getting everyone vaccinated.. I am a very young and healthy student, aside from Moderate asthma. My school reached out and offered me the Moderna shot on account of my medical history with the asthma / infections that made it worse over my years at school, as well as my designation as a student on the medical campus who is always around health care providers. While I\\'m not too concerned about my health nor convinced my asthma is too severe a comorbidity, I took that shot without a question. Every vaccine in every arm helps.. &gt;Unfortunately, they did not have any extras last night for the approximately 10 of us who waited, but I will try again a couple times.\\n\\nAbsolutely! Noone accuses people waiting on standby for a seat on a full airplane of cutting the line, the same is true for trying to get extra doses when you don\\'t qualify. Good luck. It\\'s the inverse with me, I qualify but my wife does not. At least if she gets sick, I can care for her with relative impunity, and she shouldn\\'t have to wait much longer until she\\'s eligible.. VaxFinder has this notification pop up:\\n\\n \"Due to limited federal supply and a large number of previously scheduled second-dose appointments, first dose appointments are no longer available today for Fenway Park, Gillette Stadium, or the Reggie Lewis Center. Please check other locations for availability.\"\\n\\nAny idea if this is the notification for today or if they just haven\\'t updated it from yesterday yet?. What‚Äôs the point of offering less appointments for vaccinations? Well, this is only just the start of the problem. I‚Äôm not eligible just yet, but if I am at some point, it‚Äôs clear when it‚Äôs time for your group - there will not be spots to get the vaccine if they are reducing the number of those who can get vaccinated. Either you have what is available to give or you don‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense for sites to limit their appointments.. What\\'s the point?  The point is that a large number of people are coming due for their second dose so there\\'s not a much available.  No one is hoarding it.. I‚Äôve seen you complaining about doses not being saved for teachers too. Where would you like these doses to come from? Doses cannot just come out of thin air. It was always going to be the case that an increased number of appointments would have to be for second doses. The current phase just rose by 40% yesterday with no increased supply yet. This is going to take a while.. There are only so many appointments and with a 2 dose series it was inevitable this would happen, especially if we keep getting almost no supply. Essentially they have to start digging into what was previously first dose supply to make sure everyone who got a first dose can get a second one.. They have two choices, and neither one is particularly right or wrong because there are pro/con arguments for both: \\n\\ncancel existing 2nd dose appointments in order to offer more first-dose appointments (and to keep doing this as long as supply is constrained)\\n\\n-or-\\n\\nbudget future first-dose appointments so that second-dose appointments are reliably met.. there is no \"point\" as this is an effect, not a cause.  it is strictly because the supply is so limited.  baker said yesterday we have the capacity to give significantly more doses than the current supply from the federal government allows.  you can\\'t give shots that don\\'t exist.. Where\\'s the love for us postal workers? During the Pandemic, while everyone stayed home and ordered your precious package, we went to work everyday to deliver for you. We were considered essential. And I\\'m not talking about letter carriers. I\\'m talking about all of us who work in distribution centers. Now we are not essential for the vaccine? You want to talk about a kick in the balls? There you go.. I mean I used to *kind of* believe in society and now I don‚Äôt believe in it at all, that‚Äôs what the pandemic changed.. The COVID situation has changed me by fucking my career path, permanently damaging relationships with people I used to respect, and making me feel like a child again. Oh, and infecting me too.. Politics has always wrestled with life and death (abortion, the rights of minority groups whether it\\'s ethnicity, race, orientation, etc).\\n\\nThe pandemic has served to polarize even further. \\n\\nStates like TX and FL are providing glimpses of the dystopian nightmare that truly unchecked \"free market\" would create -- setting up vaccination clinics for only wealth neighborhoods, utilities that fail and times of urgent need, and a government that literally states that business success is more important than citizen\\'s lives (worse yet, make good on that rhetoric through executive action and laws).\\n\\nEven in Massachusetts we\\'re seeing how the haves and have nots are being forced to choose between health and livelihood. There\\'s been no substantial change to protect or reward our essential workers -- those that put the food and supplies in our homes -- they weren\\'t even given priority access to vaccinations, or any wage improvements, which was the least we could do as a state. We\\'ve set a moratorium on evictions, but there is no plan for the people who are being left behind, they\\'re likely to simply be evicted when things loosen up and then become \"untouchable\" to new landlords who see that history, how do we solve that?\\n\\nI have never been more concerned for the future of the country and our society than I am now.. Oh man!  The triple whammy.  \\n\\nI feel some of all of this, personally, but I didn\\'t get infected.  I will soon complete my vaccinations.\\n\\nI feel like I will emerge from this worse for wear and not knowing what to do next.   On the other hand, I\\'ve often felt like that in the past and things have turned out alright.  \\n\\nI wish for you peace and brighter days.. March 11th for state run sites, but pharmacies are run by the feds and are adhering to their guidelines. You can still get it at CVS/Walgreens/etc. starting now.. This makes a ton of sense.  There just aren\\'t that many K-12 teachers - I\\'ve heard 70K? - so if we can spent a couple of weeks getting as many of them as possible vaccinated, we can get our kids back in school, and start to get more people able to get back to work full time.  This is a huge, positive step - especially for working mothers.. This is great, but they haven‚Äôt set a date for the next Group yet, right?. Logistical question: They open mass vaccine site appointments for the next week starting on Thursdays. Does this mean teachers will be eligible to make an appointment tomorrow as long as the appointment itself is after March 11th? Or does this mean the appointments that will drop on March 11th (for March 18th and later) will be open for teachers?. Thank you Joe Biden and CVS for calling Charlie\\'s bluff!  \\n\\nThis is only happening because after Biden\\'s recent moves, CVS went rogue and decided to start vaccinating teachers.  There are other sites that ave already started doing this too but I won\\'t call them out as they may not have a CVS sized legal team.  Baker re-iterated that teachers are not yet eligible and CVS said \"we are acting in line with federal guidance.\"   \\n\\nBaker would have looked like an impotent ass if he doubled down, so he\\'s folding fast and hoping repugs won\\'t notice he lost the dick measuring contest.. Might as well just start all of phase 2 group 3 on March 11th and cover all essential workers.. Talk about a big FU to the grocery, sanitation and other food industry workers. They didn\\'t get to \"work\" remote in 2020 and most saw no hazard pay while working along side sick co-workers or customers.. Good to see we‚Äôre still vaccinating those most likely to complain rather than those most likely to die. Imagine a 30 year-old healthy teacher getting vaccinated ahead of a 70 year-old cancer patient. Never mind that there‚Äôs zero evidence that Covid is spreading through schools. Teachers and their unions are a precious bunch.. It\\'s political. I\\'m going to pass for now.. Hi going to pass for now, I\\'m Dad! :). BOSTON (CBS) ‚Äì\\xa0Teachers are now listed as eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine in Massachusetts at CVS locations, according to an update to their\\xa0website Wednesday morning.\\n\\nThe site added ‚ÄúTeachers K-12, Daycare and preschool workers, and staff‚Äù to its eligibility list overnight.\\n\\nThis comes after President Biden issued a\\xa0directive Tuesday for retail pharmacies across the country to give teachers access to the vaccine. The president wants states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and school staff by the end of March. This is great news! - The CVS website is WAY easier to navigate than the terrible state site. Remember to signup for the text service, or keep an eye on the waiting room page. \\n\\nhttps://www.covidvaccinetexts.com/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.cvs.com/vaccine/intake/store/covid-screener/covid-qns\\n\\nFor the waiting room, go through the prescreen till you get to the page where it asks for a location. If it says \"all are booked in your area\" just stay on that page and periodically search again until something pops up.. That is so awesome! I do wish other essential employees had been bumped up as well, but this is definitely a step in the right direction, especially since the CVS vaccine sign up is roughly six billion times easier and more intuitive than the state website.. I guess I know what I\\'ll be spending my free time doing now.... Good to see Biden forcing this, preventing certain state level politicians who have it out for teachers unions from using their lives as bargaining chips.. I am happy for teachers but this must be rough news for anyone who is sick and already struggling for appointments. Phase 2 just grew by 10%.. This is great news. I‚Äôm very happy for our teachers we need them more than ever. \\n\\nUnrelated to that good news, this annoys me from the article - just make the announcement and move on. You don‚Äôt need a photo op for every damn thing. \\n\\nHe is scheduled to make an announcement about vaccinations at a school in Gloucester at 9 a.m. Wednesday. Interestingly enough, the cashiers at those CVS vaccine sites who come in close proximity with hundreds of different people a day just got kicked farther down the line.. Fun times.  The CVS pharmacies in the Berkshires aren\\'t on the website.. As an educator, this is AMAZING!!!\\n\\nAs a daughter who has spent weeks trying to get her 68 year old father an appointment - this suuuucks.. Baker said that teachers will be eligible starting the 11th (which is a Thursday) so I expect other sites will open to teachers at that point. Thank you for sharing!!. Yep. I will be refreshing all day. Thank you! Took long enough to get us educators to get the vaccine!!!. I\\'ve seen people registering on the CVS App - is that the normal CVS app? It directs me to the browser website each time + link appears to be gone from app today.. it\\'s nice to see Executive, Federal &amp; States working together for again. Is Walgreens doing the same? They also get their vaccines from the feds. Ah, excellent. Does anyone know if substitute teachers qualify for this?. Still no for type 1 diabetes. Good job assholes. Does this include childcare workers who work inside the home? Like nannies?. Excellent news.. Worcester has been helping to set up appointments for people who fell into tier 1 (typically due to their licensure.) they might do the same for teachers in the coming weeks. But that might be wishful thinking on my part. Does anyone know if we need to bring any form of school ID with us when we go for the vaccination appointments? I was able to make an appointment for the day after tomorrow but I can\\'t find my school ID.. Can they check, my wife hasn‚Äôt thought in a yr and moved from NJ, she is teacher though but hasn‚Äôt taken the exam in NJ. I turned off updates for subreddit why did I just get a notification for it.. This is bullshit. Vote it down all you want, cowards. Not enough political pull to get type 1 moved up. The first Lady is all about the Teachers and that\\'s why this happened. How much of the school year is left? 2 months? Suck it.. Does all this mean that Pfizer and moderna are not available to get. Im 74 and will take Johnson,as it\\'s made from some part of the live virus.. Neither the mRNA (Moderna/Pfizer) or Adenovirus (J&amp;J) vaccines have live virus.... * [Imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/7I4Yjv3)\\n* Data source: [MDPH COVID-19 Dashboard ](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring) \\n* [The Tableau Public version of this data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/somethinginnocuous#!/vizhome/MACOVID-19Data/Past60Days) \\n* [MDHP Weekly Vaccination Report](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/preparing-for-a-covid-19-vaccine#weekly-covid-19-vaccination-report-)\\n* [MWRA Wastewater COVID-19 Tracking](http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm)\\n* [Town-based Trends in MA](https://matowncovid.org/) \\n* [Testing Trends in Massachusetts](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/massachusetts)\\n* Comparative Data: [91-DIVOC](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/). Really strange trends.  You\\'d expect with seniors getting through vaccinations that deaths and hospitalizations would be decreasing.  Hospitalizations are, but deaths aren\\'t.  \\n\\nThe positive case count has basically plateaued.  Low mask and social distancing adherence over the recent vacation are likely the cause.  But now schools are starting to fully open up while the community spread remains moderate to high in almost every town, so while a final surge might not come, I can certainly see a very very long tail continuing into the summer.. Are you affiliated with the Beth Israel Lahey Mount Auburn group? I received the same invitation because my doctor belongs to the group. I was informed that they would contact me when a vaccine becomes available. They did not specify which vaccine.. My father got one from Beth Israel Deaconess, he got pfizer from them. When my husband got his from them, he was told they were using both Moderna and Pfizer.  His was Pfizer.  It‚Äôs not clear whether they were using both that day or just using one, but it could change from day to day. \\n\\nThis was before J&amp;J was approved, so it‚Äôs entirely possible it‚Äôs a random choice between all three now.. I got that invitation and sat on it for a week as the locations were less than ideal for me.  I accepted it yesterday and booked an appointment 3 weeks out.\\n\\nI do not care one bit which vaccine I get.  It is a miracle they even have options only one year after the outbreak.. I have no idea. I had the Pfizer last Friday in North Dartmouth. Pfizer or Moderna  is good.. I think it depends where exactly you get vaccinated. I got the Moderna one through BILH. I got a text and email today to make an appointment. But I beat them by two days . I had my first shot on Monday in Boston.. The available location In the link of my invitation only Dorchester and North Quincy rn, but I am living at North shore ü§£. On the mass.gov website it tells you which location has which vaccine.. These aren\\'t through the government site in the same way, these are invitations to existing people in the hospital system.  The hospital based clinics generally have a mic of types and use what they have that day. Solid day.  I like it. I CAN\\'T HEAR YOU!  THERES A VACCINE PRINTER RAGING BACK THERE!.

Teachers and daycare workers are showing as eligible on the CVS website, but no slots are open.. That Walgreens link appears broken, fyi. This is awesome. Thanks!. r/aboringdystopia. Yeah this is sad. We need all these resources just to get ourselves vaccinated when it\\'s our turn.... The press conference has not started yet, but teachers, if you can find an appointment, you may be able to sign up with CVS.. Yea so baker just said that there are only 58k vaccines available this month from j&amp;j provided by the feds and no more will be here til probably april. He said the current phase will take priority.\\n\\nEdit- he just said if you are an educator, you can try to book next week through MA.Gov. \\n\\nEdit- Today, Educators can book through pharmacies like CVS, etc.. This is now 30 minutes overdue to start, what the heck?. Teachers and Day Care Workers March 11 at all sites.\\n\\nState should announce more slots on Thursday.. March 11th for state run sites, but pharmacies are run by the feds and are adhering to their guidelines. You can still get it at CVS/Walgreens/etc. starting now.. Is anyone else having trouble viewing the livestream?. \"Matt Blanchette, a spokesman for CVS, told the Globe on Wednesday that the company is aligning with updated Federal Retail Pharmacy Program guidelines by making appointments available to pre-K through 12th grade educators and staff and child-care workers in all 17 states where the retail pharmacy currently offers COVID-19 vaccines, which includes Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/03/03/metro/cvs-allows-teachers-sign-up-vaccine-appointments/. But, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsaving‚Äù doses for teachers. It‚Äôs like the hunger games for vaccines. It shouldn‚Äôt be this way. If you‚Äôre pushing for us to be back in school full time in April, it‚Äôs time to make us a priority and provide the vaccine to us instead of having it be a free for all. That‚Äôs not fair.. It\\'s political. Sounds like they\\'re going to have special clinics for this classification offered starting the sign-ups on March 11th.   That will actually give them a leg up but it won\\'t be enough.   There will still be more seekers than appointments, even in the special clinics, because of a shortage of incoming doses.. Our school district has pushed their full time start date twice now and it\\'s pending teacher vaccinations. I can\\'t even imagine how frustrating it is to plan childcare and work around this.. Who would you like to de-prioritize?. Saving doses didn\\'t work in DC either. Vox\\'s the Weeds podcast had a good episode about that - a bunch of teachers didn\\'t take the vaccine, so the doses were just sitting there.\\n\\nImo, schools shouldn\\'t be opened this school year. Wait until September. Then everyone has a fair shot to get fully vaccinated. And to boot, all the parents &amp; older kids/college kids particularly get a shot to be vaccinated. We have limited supply now, so why try and rush stuff? Supply will increase in March, April, May, etc. By July, there should be capacity to get everyone an appointment. And demand will have lessened as by that point we\\'ll be hitting the most in demand groups.. MODERATOR NOTE:  We have not vetted these volunteers.  Be careful with your personal information.  If in doubt, don\\'t.  Use 2-1-1 and contact your local town or regional health department as an alternative.. The social media effect is real.. What is going on in the netherlands. They were burning down 5G towers, burning and arsoning covid test centers and now this.. I know we have some really fucking dumb people in this world, but first burning down the 5G towers, and then just regular arson at covid test centres, and now just straight up bombing the place? what the fuck is wrong with people?. I know every nation on this planet has their idiots but if this is intentional... Damn man.. It meantions Urk. \\n\\nIsn\\'t that the Luton of the Netherlands?. Ah Netherlands...the US of the EU. \\n\\nI am joking.. It was the 5G getting too concentrated. /s. You shouldn\\'t be, it\\'s very apt... you can still find the progenitor of the stereotypical slack-jawed yokel in the bogs of Holland.. everything is the US of the world if you\\'re a frog inside a well looking upwards. As an American, I laughed heartily at this.. the only thing the Us has in common with the netherlands is that the US stole the dutch constitution and added guns. This makes no sense isn‚Äôt Netherlands liberal af like you can freely do drugs there or get hookers. I cannot wait for that day when we turn the corner and I don\\'t have to wear a mask at work for 8 hours. Then the roaring 20s can start again.. Just so everyone is clear, this means we will have enough doses to vaccinate everyone. Not that we will have everyone vaccinated.\\n\\nStill great news though. great news\\n\\nI noticed my local walgreens was starting to distribute it too in the future which got me interested. Maybe in a few weeks or so we\\'ll have enough so that we can just drive by our local store, get a shot, and go home. We are and remain the luckiest humans who ever lived. A hundred generations died of smallpox and whooping cough and tetanus and measles, never hearing of a vaccine, most having no idea such a miracle could exist.... Nice to see some good news for a change. *watches sadly from canada*. My state has been stuck in phase 1B since early January.  It feels like it will never proceed beyond that.  \\n\\nI just want my jab(s)... Sigh.... 4th of July this year is going to be massive. A consolation prize given that today 2 governors prematurely ended their state\\'s phased re-openings and mask mandates. Finally some good news. I would assume a significant % of adults don‚Äôt even want the vaccine or are in no rush to get one. So anyone who wants one can probably get it even sooner.. I hate to be a pessimist, but I\\'ll believe it when I see it.\\n\\nSo many local public health facilities are still only doing people 75+.\\n\\nHow many old people are there?!  The vaccine has been a thing for more than a month now, and they\\'re still only giving it to the oldest people among us.  I find it hard to believe that they will be able to give out vaccines to EVERYONE in the next 3 months.. Let\\'s hurry this shit the fuck up I wanna travel and for the economy to not collapse.. I‚Äôm just ready to lick my fingers when trying to open up grocery bags at the store. That‚Äôs my one true weakness that‚Äôs been exposed.. This is great and all but until more places can actually vaccinate it doesn‚Äôt matter.\\n\\nIn NY its a god damn disaster. Good luck getting an appointment. Its to the point where people are writing bots and following twitter accounts to get alerted for open appointments and they‚Äôre all filled up by the time you can do it.\\n\\nIts literally just like buying a PS5.. Meanwhile the worst state, Tennessee, is doing everything they can to make this thing endemic: [https://covid19.tn.gov/covid-19-vaccines/vaccine-phases/](https://covid19.tn.gov/covid-19-vaccines/vaccine-phases/)  \\n\\n\\nHardly vaccinating anybody, plus no mask mandates.. in my area it seems like the age bracket is dropping 5 yrs every 1-2 weeks. Wait what about children?. Need to start having vaccinations offered at every Walmart. Would reach many people who otherwise wouldn‚Äôt care to seek out the vaccine on their own. Also probably the most at risk populations for several reasons.. Let\\'s fucking goooooooooo holy poop finally. Does this mean summer may not be canceled?. Oh look, competent people with a plan.. Here\\'s to hoping every adult actually gets the vaccine, although I\\'m sure that won\\'t be the case.. I keep reading that the supply of vaccine is growing but for some reason California isn\\'t even getting enough supply this week to cover 2nd doses for people. What kind of shenanigans are going on?. Good, good. Now my local riteaid can run out of appointments in 40 seconds, instead of 20.. Which manufacturer? \\nWhen will it open up to immunocompromised?. \"Please, Sir. I want some more.\". So who the hell is getting these vaccines? Have 75+ parents/relatives that need vaccines and haven\\'t been able to get a single shot yet.. All 3 currently approved vaccines are part of this 500k. The estimate for 1c is still the same.. So what I don\\'t understand. Is that in 2 weeks, they\\'ll open it for everyone 50 and up. Then, why aren\\'t we including more essential workers and adults over 18 with health issues within the generic 50 and up eligibility? Like, idk I would think someone under 50 who has severe health conditions or works in an essential industry, shouldn\\'t continue to have to wait and should be def included in the generic 50 and up category.. Frontline workers please. We\\'re about to hit a turning point in the next month or so where states are going to get a LOT more doses than they have been getting up to this point. Not just with J&amp;J starting distribution, but with Moderna/Pfizer increasing production as well.\\n\\nIt\\'s the right call to drop the eligibility age, IMO, I think Whitmer is anticipating the increase in doses with each shipment here. It\\'s hard to imagine now with how scarce the vaccine has been but things are about to shift in a pretty dramatic way. Especially with Biden saying we should have enough doses to vaccinate all adults by the end of May and knowing that, according to some polls, up to 40% of adults don\\'t even want the vaccine right now (or right away) anyway.\\n\\nBasically, I think we\\'re about to start speeding through tiers here. Especially if large amounts of Michiganders are just straight turning it down right now.. I\\'m surprised this doesn\\'t include caregiver family members who care for senior citizen parents.  I\\'m 47 with a pre-existing condition and I take care of my parents including a mother who\\'s stage 4.. How about get the 65+ that can\\'t get a fucking appointment vaccinated first???,. This needs to be on the honor system. It puts too much pressure on doctors offices to constantly answer calls and write notes, arrange for pick ups of notes. I really hope they don‚Äôt make people jump through hoops.. Took me 6 weeks of trying at the Macomb Health Department. Finally got through this week.. so what exactly are they considering pre-existing? high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer survivor, etc?  Does anybody know or do we have to wait for MDHHS?. I don\\'t pretend to know all of the details but it seems like the handling of the vaccine rollout in Michigan has been pretty poor. I know many seniors still waiting to get an appointment and yet here we are expanding eligibility. These are individuals that are clearly at risk and are being very careful but have been let down by this process. Some with COPD, emphysema are bewildered as they watch much younger individuals who are not frontline workers receive vaccines ahead of them. A very confusing, muddy process where they are having to sign up for vaccines at multiple locations (Meijer, Rite Aid, CVS, etc.) while their primary care physicians are able to do nothing for them. I\\'m sad that they\\'ve been so let down by this process.. Can we give  the most elderly a chance to get vaccinated first? My 80+ parents are still waiting for an appointment.. Hmm wonder if having a history of any of those conditions qualifies.  My mom is a couple years removed from cancer treatment, would be awesome to get her in ASAP.. Dilly....take a number &amp; get in line....same \\'o same \\'o.... Does this include smokers? Think meijer  included smokers along with people with health conditions.. Hey everyone! I live in Illinois but my parents live in MI. I have been following this community for updates (thank you!). They will be eligible when this opens up. They are in Kent county. They are registered with Meijer. I will look at Rite Aid. Who else is offering it? CVS? Walgreens? Costco? Urgent care places? Sorry.. I‚Äôm having a tough time finding this info. Seems to be more widely available in IL. Thanks for the help!. \"Fuck essential workers\" Neoliberals.. Hey why don\\'t you go fuck yourself instead, you prick.. The article doesn\\'t mention where the transmission happened or most likely happened.    \\nI know of 3 out breaks in school systems high schools were traced back to gatherings supported and coordinated by the parents.   South Lyon last fall,  Lapeer the recent one and Brighton also last fall.. Huh .....imagine that.. These kids couldn‚Äôt go to school for almost a year, but we can let them pile into a locker room with each Other and pack a bus full to other schools. Makes perfect sense.. I teach in Metro Detroit and of my students told me that there was a 16th birthday party over the weekend with over 100 guests. No wonder half of the school is staying online...\\n\\nA lot of cities have seen declines in cases. Not where I teach. It‚Äôs just infection central. Deaths haven‚Äôt been nearly as bad as other cities, but the average age in the community is wayyyyyyyy lower than Michigan‚Äôs average age.. My kids go to two different schools. One went back to full in-person, lasted 3 weeks before the number of positive tests and close contacts in quarantine pushed them back into hybrid. My kid got sent into quarantine due to a positive student in one class that she\\'s never spoken to. There were more reported positive cases in those three weeks than any time this school year. \\n\\nMy other kid\\'s school was operating hybrid, just switched to in-person the same day kid #1\\'s school went back to hybrid. \\n\\nThese schools are in towns next door to each other. Why can\\'t they pay attention? There aren\\'t enough vaccinated people around us yet.. It\\'s been discussed amd proved many times that schools are not super spreaders. There\\'s even peer reviewed articles concerning it.  Private schools have been back the entire school year. Where\\'s the outbreaks? Fact of the matter here is this is a pandemic...these kids could have gotten it anywhere.. Northville has one of the highest cases per 1k students compared to surrounding districts  they are up to 189 total students+ staff positives and have like 7500 kids.\\n\\nWith the exception of September and the state shutdown over Christmas high school students have been in person hybrid 2 days a week. \\n\\nThis is literally the 2nd offical outbreak.\\nIt may be from out of school socializing but they really do seem to be very unlucky.. covidiots be like \"grandma had her chance to vax now its **SPORTSBALL\\'S‚Ñ¢** chance\". Considering some of these schools haven\\'t masked or distanced the entire time, because this is Macomb county, I have a hard time believing that\\'s all the cases but they definitely fought hard to spread disease either way. Macomb County. The Florida of Michigan.. % of new cases each day that are in ages 0-19 has remained between 19-21% on average since 1/26, so it looks to me like the school outbreaks are perhaps getting more concentrated, not necessarily increasing. OMG yes.  This made me laugh. Thank you.. QOTD. What\\'s worse is what\\'s happening in Italy right now is our warning.\\n\\nThe UK variant is now affecting schoolchildren MORE than older people. This message that children are not affected by covid (which is a lie, in and of itself) is going to back fire on us. And right now it feels as though our government is encouraging the spread - not preventing it...\\n\\nBut oh the economy...\\n\\nMore about Italy:\\nhttps://apnews.com/article/italy-virus-variant-children-d763a3e484cc74be866067a6adf16ced \\n\\nMore about covid and children:\\n\\nhttps://www.acc.org/about-acc/press-releases/2020/12/02/17/08/covid19-can-impact-young-childrens-hearts\\n\\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200904125111.htm\\n\\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mis-c-in-kids-covid-19/symptoms-causes/syc-20502550\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mlive.com/news/2021/01/10-year-old-faces-long-road-after-amputation-due-to-severe-case-of-covid-19-linked-syndrome.html%3foutputType=amp\\n\\nhttps://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/grand-rapids/michigan-boy-w-rare-covid-condition-to-require-amputation\\n\\nhttps://www.amputee-coalition.org/resources/covid-19-helping-children-families-cope/\\n\\nhttps://www.news-medical.net/amp/news/20200524/Children-with-COVID-19-presenting-with-sudden-severe-lung-disease.aspx\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/cbs12.com/amp/news/local/doctors-concerned-that-covid-19-may-be-harming-lungs-of-children. &gt; In recent days, authorities have taken to sealing off many towns and cities in areas where transmission rates are rapidly increasing.\\n\\nOoooooof.

Without knowing what your job is, you‚Äôre at least a part of Phase 1C which hasn‚Äôt begun yet. So the answer, currently, is nowhere.. Going to depend on what county you\\'re in. Macomb for example is kind of vague, but is allowing some critical infrastructure workers to be vaccinated.. Stalk vaccine clinics. That‚Äôs how my husband who is in the same position got his in late January. It probably saved his life, as he is at high risk.. http://www.vaxxmax.com/\\n\\nThis site scans open apts at rite_aid and wall greens. If you qualify by the guidelines you can sign up. 1b and do I contact the county health dpt then?. I think it\\'s a mistake until more people are vaccinated. We\\'ll just see another resurgence, plus those two new strains.. &gt; The rollback of a litany of COVID-19 regulations by Whitmer and the state health department corresponds with improving pandemic trends in the state. But it appears to contradict at least some advice from national experts, who ‚Äî like the state ‚Äî note that virus variants may result in more outbreaks despite increases in vaccination efforts. \\n\\nAbout that...\\n\\n**[CDC chief warns of \\'potential fourth surge\\' and urges US to keep Covid rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/lvgufu/cdc_chief_warns_of_potential_fourth_surge_and/)**\\n\\n1388 positive day last week, 1067 positive today, Michigan\\'s #2 in the nation for # of variants, outbreaks at 29 schools in 1 week.\\n\\nGood luck!. Huge for a lot of restaurants and bars across the state. Pushing back the 10pm curfew to 11pm will also help capacity issues.. Not too surprising with the vaccines rolling out, people should still be careful though, especially if they haven\\'t been vaccinated yet.. Friday? *This* ***Friday?*** At the best case scenario, if you live in Michigan and we‚Äôre actually able to get your first dose today, it would still be 30 days before the vaccine was effective enough. And she wants to start reopening now?. Ahh yes just in time for st Patrick\\'s day partying.. Uhhhh... good news according to whom exactly?. Bowing to the selfish.. That\\'s great for them, but I\\'m going to remain overly cautious until later in the summer after I\\'m fully vaccinated.. The lack of sympathy for these restaurant owners and employees from this sub is disappointing. Of course restaurants are going to pressure to open up. Top Golf is filling up every bay with people waiting in the lobby. Gyms are full of people with masks down to their chin. The government is telling them to close down for months and handing them a few dollars to barely survive while these other industries are thriving.. Sounds like there was a governors meeting and good news was presented.. Man a whole bunch of people on here are way over cautious lol. A whole bunch of people are already vaccinated, a whole bunch more are going to be vaccinated in the next month, and a whole bunch of people already have had COVID. The point of the restrictions was to not allow the hospitals from getting overwhelmed and even if we do see a minor resurgence that\\'s not going to happen at this point.. Suicides in Michigan are a yearly average of 1472, adjusted for current population. In 2020, there were ~1500 suicides in Michigan.\\n\\nThis equals an increase of 2%.. &gt;suicides are skyrocketing \\n\\nWhile there is uncertainty, there is currently no evidence to support this in the United States. There are worrying signs of increased risk of suicide, like reported anxiety, and some shifts between suicide rates of some subgroups in certain locations, but no data suggesting a significant overall change in suicide rates one way or the other in the US since the pandemic began. Data on recent months in the US is notably still incomplete, but there are no preliminary signs of increased rates.\\n\\nA December 2020 [Newsweek article](https://www.newsweek.com/suicide-rate-dropped-lowest-level-since-1999-last-year-trend-may-not-continue-2020-1556846) explained:\\n\\n&gt;\"We do not yet know about suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic because the United States does not collect suicide data in real time, therefore, claims about increasing suicide rates during COVID-19 are not based in current available data and are unfounded,\" said American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Chief Medical Officer Christine Moutier in a Tuesday statement. \"Emerging data from several countries show no evidence of increased suicide rates during the first few months of the pandemic.\"\\n\\nAnother recent discussion of the issue was presented in a January 2021 article in *The New York Times Magazine,* entitled \"[Will the Pandemic Result in More Suicides?\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/magazine/will-the-pandemic-result-in-more-suicides.html).\\n\\nThere was a recent study on increased suicide rates in Japan, specifically of women.\\n\\nI think it\\'s also worth keeping in perspective that there are normally around 50,000 suicide deaths per year in the US, compared to around 500,000 deaths from COVID in the past year.. Misinformation. Reported. Banned.. Cool, more for us City Folk.... The region they\\'re discussing includes Grand Rapids, the second most populous city in the state; they just aren\\'t big on post-Renaissance science.\\n\\nI\\'m surprised to see Wayne/Oakland/Macomb counties with the highest acceptance rate. I read several anecdotal accounts explaining Detroit\\'s low vaccination rate as being because many black residents refused vaccines due to historical discrimination and undisclosed testing on black Americans. A good cautionary reminder to be skeptical of anecdotes, especially when used to explain racial disparity in the US.. Well I\\';ll happily take their slots for my family.. Judging by the extraordinary amount of Michiganders that ARE getting the vaccine...apparently Biden DID win Michigan. Means I can have it faster right?. Conservatives are a threat to civil society.. Ok. Can\\'t say I\\'m surprised.. gee, these are the same idiots having meltdowns about masks and social distancing, with their g.i. joe cosplay rallies at the capitol, and their plots to kidnap the governor. when did the gop go from the party of law &amp; order to the party of disorder, defiance, insurrection, and treason? \\n\\nthe saddest part? they confuse those things for \"patriotism\".. Something, something, natural selection.. They need to be required to carry a license or something that states this, on par with blood donor and eye status. It\\'s not just Republicans, I\\'ve got weirdo coworkers who are either moderate or blatantly anti Trump who are not getting it or plan to wait until \"the very last possible moment\" (her words) to get it. It\\'s dangerous for those of us who have been as careful as possible, and with loved ones who actually need protection.... More to go around for people who give a shit. 1, 2 COVID\\'s coming for you. Must be following their \"\\'chosen one\" trump. Wow, that\\'s a lot of really stupid people then. Glad more than half are getting it, but *almost* half not getting it? Fucking A, so many GQP conspiracy driven, democracy hating, fools.. Let them ‚ú®die‚ú®. Good\\n\\nEdit: Covid deniers shouldn‚Äôt be able to get it.. I don\\'t see a problem. Agreed. Once vaccines are broadly available (which looks like it will happen fairly soon) the only people who are going to be hurt by not getting a vaccine are *those people*. I feel sorry for their kids, but if you\\'re an adult who\\'s making a conscious decision not to get it, the consequences are yours to bear, and I\\'ve got zero sympathy.. Yeah same, if they die they die idc. Every instance of open vial extra doses I\\'ve heard of in Michigan, they distributed to people from a list or who were present and qualified by the current state standards - so you would need to be a member of group 1A or 1B even if it\\'s an open vial because most of these places have waitlists\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if it\\'s a law or if they saw vaccine chasers in other states and took action to combat them but it\\'s definitely the standard practice to call a waitlist of qualified people and deter chasers. I haven\\'t seen a state policy, but at the clinics in my county they try to get to anyone qualified first - but if that can\\'t get anyone in time, they\\'ve offered it to non-vaccinated volunteers at the clinic.  While I think due diligence to get a 1A-1C person in should be done, it\\'s also important that no vaccines go to waste.\\n\\nI believe Counties, Hospitals, etc. are supposed to follow the state guidelines but I\\'ve heard that local officials can make different judgments without repercussions (assuming nothing unethical)  e.g. Detroit allowing 55+ to get vaccinated if they bring someone 60+. I‚Äôve seen pharmacies distribute to anyone available who wants it.. Yes. I haven\\'t read reports of misuse either, but that sounds naively optimistic to me. I pessimistically assume that means things are as corrupt here as they were elsewhere, people just learned they better not brag on Facebook about their boyfriend bringing home an unused dose for them, or whatever corrupt practice got them vaccinated. It\\'s possible people spontaneously got more ethical on their own though.. Glad to hear the standard practice is to work from a waitlist or administer to other qualified people present.  I\\'ve heard of a person in group 2 getting a vaccine this way in MI and hopefully that was just a one-off instance.  Or maybe people sharing a story in which they didn\\'t have all the facts.. I‚Äôm just glad I got both doses of the vaccine before they brought us back to work.. My local school parents ar throwing a fit about the lack of school dances and are trying to figure out how to hold them in a barn somewhere. I need to move.. It will be getting worse as Gov. Whitmer is pushing for all schools to be face to face. I haven‚Äôt seen any data on preschool or daycare Covid numbers. I know there are cases.. Play stupid games.. There are cases and school districts aren\\'t reporting most of them\\n\\nThere are terrible outbreaks in some districts/schools (surely daycares too because I know a couple are reporting cases) which are being completely covered up (source: I know employees of the districts) and that\\'s been constant since the sports practices last summer and the return in September\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t magically changed now that the state supports a return but happened the whole time. 5 months ago: BETSY DEVOS EVIL, WANTS KIDS IN SCHOOL\\n\\nNow: BIDEN SAYS KIDS MUST BE IN SCHOOL, DO SO\\n\\nDoesn\\'t matter how many times I hear \"schools can be made safe with procedures\", it won\\'t be. Kids sportsball have their masks off all the time indoors, kids will forget to put mask on, kids will intentionally cough on each other as bullying, underpaid school employees will be lax, no school is going to drop $250,000 to upgrade its HVAC without some serious state or fed $$$ giveaway, then all the \"COVID is a hoax\" parents + employees.\\n\\nThe other week someone opened up a school gym in Flint to have an unsanctioned wrestling tournament, no masks. Boom, COVID outbreak. Repercussions for infecting others on taxpayers dime? Nope.\\n\\nSo, shocker, here we are with 26 school outbreaks in 1 week. Coupled with the grocery store outbreaks + stronger UK variant, we\\'re realllllllllly asking for it.\\n\\nEDIT: school gym, not just \"gym\" @ Flint. Too many people simply don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt want the inconvenience. You don‚Äôt have covid if you don‚Äôt get tested, right?. I think she\\'s referring to the just-a-flu anti masker anti vaccine no-common-sensors who also happen to be anti-test.. I\\'d get tested if I felt any symptoms...? So, like, she\\'s concerned that people arent getting as sick as they once where? Like it\\'s a bad thing? I\\'m an idiot, but that headline seems kinda weird.. yes, like HIV!. Best time to shop at Macys was at 3am that one Xmas year where they stayed open 24 hours for the week leading up to it.. I wish the overnight hours were available to everyone. I work graveyards and would happily go before my shift starts at 4 am. I feel like demand for these times is going to be super low. If it puts more shots in more people\\'s arms, I\\'m for it.. Can anyone sign up for these appointments?. I just signed up for my vaccine at 3:30AM because it was the only time available... I forget which vaccine it was, is there a chance it could be J&amp;J without my knowledge?. I have an appointment at the Javits on 3/4 at 6pm, does this mean that I‚Äôll be getting J&amp;J?. Are you allowed to get two vaccines?. What do I do if I don‚Äôt have insurance?. If your target audience is overnight people, why is your go live time for signups 8 to 11 am.... Too bad the subway is still being closed at 1.. About fucking time. If this is really a crisis / war / or whatever you want to call it we need to treat it like one. Vaccination sites running 24/7! Vaccines should be used within days not weeks.. That‚Äôs smart. Lots of night owls out there, and at even higher concentrations in the city. That is biased towards young people, though. So I‚Äôm worried it may not be as effective now because of that, and the trial gets cancelled before vaccines open up to the younger generations who are more likely to make use of overnight hours.. I checked earlier no appointments available.. I wish they\\'d include queens and Brooklyn but this is better than nothing. I\\'m guessing the only reason they didn\\'t do this earlier was lack of vaccinations. Hopefully as more and more numbers are available this will be the norm with no restrictions.. It\\'s in the tweet, but appointments for these specific vaccine doses don\\'t go live until Wed @ 11am and Thurs at 8am for Yankee Stadium and Javits, respectively.. Realistically ... population 8,400,000.  80% adults, so 6,720,000 people remaining.  Out of those 6,720,000, maybe 75% are willing to be vaccinated, so we\\'re down to about 5 million.  We\\'ll need 10 million doses total, except that J&amp;J is single-dose.  \\n\\nWe\\'ve administered 2 million, so 8 million to go, assuming two doses per person.  Assuming an even split between Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J going forward, each can give 2 million doses, since J&amp;J\\'s 2 million would actually \"count\" for 4 million doses.\\n\\nSo really, only 6 million shots needed.  If we can maintain 50,000 per day, we should be able to vaccinate everyone who wants one in the city of New York in the next four months, by early July.  In reality, this will take a bit longer, since out-of-city in-person workers may also want a dose.  But we should have significant penetration by early summer, in any case.  \\n\\nIt looks like we\\'ve hit 83,000 one day ... if the upper bound is limited by available doses, not available sites, and this isn\\'t due to bad reporting practices, we could be done even sooner.  Maybe by end of May or early June!  Get all of the vulnerable people, and hospital cases should dive off a cliff much sooner.. God I wish that was me üíâüíâ. Will NYC start administering the J&amp;J vaccine? I know some places will start with it this week but not sure if NYC is on that list.. Another good thing is that there were many vaccine trials for all of the 4 major vaccines in NYC. At least 50% or more got the vaccine instead of the placebo.. Texas fully open...yeehaw. Some good progress. I hope with Johnson &amp; Johnson we can really get at least half of the adult population vax\\'d by this summer - and with a few people who already have immunity from getting covid, I think the infection rate should be plummeting by then.. Good news. My father got his first last week and my mother will get hers next week. Thank you to turbovax.info for making it possible to find appointments easily (hint: turn on twitter notifications). By the end of April basically everyone in the USA who wants a vaccine will have at least once dose, which will be enough to bring Covid down to less than Flu lethality. We\\'re vaccinating 2.5m per day now, that\\'s 150m shots by then.. has anyone been able to snag leftover doses that would otherwise get thrown out?. Five more days until I get my first shot!. Do the vaccine sites require documentation for comorbidities? I\\'m not 65 or obese but my liver is fucked. It\\'s been a few years though since I\\'ve been to a doctor so I wouldn\\'t be able to show test results. \\n\\nI set an appointment for my parents for early April but if I went with them, would I be able to get a leftover shot?. Great, can we open indoor dining more so I can go back to work?. Does anybody know how to find out which sites administer which vaccines?. My father will hopefully be part of that statistic on April 14. I was finally able to book him an appointment yesterday. He runs a deli and finding an appointment was such a struggle.. But how many actual NYC residents have been vaccinated? Non NYC residents are eligible for the vaccine within NYC so the 2 million doses is slightly misleading.. Is being a smoker still a preexisting condition? Does weed count?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSomeone find me a jab pls. I checked yesterday and it said 500k fully vaccinated in NYC. At I looking at the wrong thing or are there 1.5M with only one dose?. I got first dose last week, BMI is .20 over lol.  I\\'ve been dieting and working out,  barely qualified.  although they didn\\'t check my bmi.. As a substitute teacher I‚Äôve been trying to get an appointment for so long. Finally was able to get the first shot because York College started giving to select zip codes. I got lucky.. I got my first :). Great, but why are there so many people walking around without masks?. My asshole father just called me from NJ where he lives to gloat about the fact that he and his wife had already received their vaccines. I was like, Dad you\\'re 80 fucking years old. To which he replied, doesn\\'t matter you need to get the vaccine immediately and why are you dilly dallying. Then he laid into me about how my step young sisters were even able to wrangle a dosage due to their \"tenacity\". \\n\\nI told him I live in NYC and we are doing all we can to get a vaccine but they are not up to our group.\\n\\nThis really made me realize that there is a culture of superiority of the vaccinated. I see it playing out on social media. People saying Pfizer is better than Moderna, which one did you get?\\n\\nLike, fuck you, man. I\\' m happy to just be vaccinated with either one when my turn comes.. curious if you have the vaccine can you travel about or??? how\\'s that work. They need to have 24 hour state run vaccination centers for anyone that wants it. This virtue signaling process needs to end. Getting as many people vaxxed as quickly as possible is more effective than this overly intricate tiering.. No credit to Cuomo, he sucks. Why is it so difficult to get the vaccine?  I\\'ve been trying for several weeks to arrange a 1st dose for my 70 yo father and there\\'s none available.. It should really be 20 million at this point. Leaders are failing us. :/. Does that mean it‚Äôs safe to go outside yet?. Cool, so this means about 1 million people or less have had their complete vaccinations as of March 2021. \\n\\nWe have had more people confirmed infected with covid (at least 1,687,443) than are immune from vaccines. If this pace continues, it will take about 20 months or so to vaccinate the entire city.. So just so I understand this correct - Things have been pretty much fully open in TX and FL for months with case spikes no different than NYC.\\n\\nYesterday TX completely dropped its mask mandate, with everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - fully open.\\n\\nBut in NYC we are blessed with 25% indoor dining and everything else remaining shuttered.\\n\\nIs anyone else thinking that maybe we no longer deserve to be punished when life is seemingly moving on in other parts of the country?. I am just guessing, but it seems like you are assuming a linear pace from the moment a single vaccine was available. That makes no sense at all.\\n\\nRate of vaccination has gone up every week and another vaccine is on the way. To make this assumption is ignoring reality.. Good news, the country will have 400 million courses of vaccine by end of July.. Have you just stuck your head in the sand and ignored the news about expected doses in the next few weeks?\\n\\nAre you this much of a bummer in real life? It must be exhausting.. [NY.gov: Vaccine location/availability Live](https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/).. Do they tell you which vaccine you will be getting when you make an appointment? Can you choose which one?. each location has only one of its kind. \\n\\nyou can check the vaccine finder site and it shows you what  brand each site is giving\\n\\n https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/locations. Don‚Äôt hold off on getting a vaccine appointment because it‚Äôs not the brand you wanted. Get the first one available as soon as it‚Äôs available.. Ticketmaster to introduce new $20 vaccine fast pass fee. Scalpers will sell excelsior account access to a vaxxed account. If enough people actually get vaccinated, what‚Äôs the point of this? I could understand this being implemented right now but what‚Äôs the point in the long run?. The primary issue with this is that it‚Äôs another data point by which you can be ‚Äútracked‚Äù. Nowhere does it mention if the data will be kept strictly confidential, where will\\nIt be stored when it‚Äôs scanned at these venues and what guarantee do we have that this data won‚Äôt be sold down the line in large data blocks for companies to data mine. It‚Äôs another haste reactionary idea with little thought to the long term effects. And it‚Äôs not paranoia to ask these questions of a government entity that is about to collect a ton of data on the comings and goings of its citizen‚Äôs.. Nah, if vaccines are available to everyone there‚Äôs no point in this anyway.\\n\\nAlso imagine it‚Äôd be terrible for tourism down the line. Does this really offer any security? You don‚Äôt instantly test positive, even on a PCR test. 3 days is a long time.. Fuck offff. No way courts go along with requiring medical info traditionally viewed as protected between doctor patient confidentiality to access facilities open to the public.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs just not going to fly if one person in the state objects and has money to engage the legal process.\\n\\nSchools don‚Äôt even get that kind of leeway,. Papers, please. Big pharma licking its lips right now.. Yeah, I\\'m sure there won\\'t be some unscrupulous person selling those easily-forged vaccination cards on Craigslist for $50.... Good, sign me up. Got my card in a box right here. People who don‚Äôt want to get the shot can stay home and zoom it up all they want.. So how do you sign up for this? There\\'s no central database for vaccines afaik. I have been vaccinated and don\\'t mind having this, but how would they prove it? (the paper cdc card isn\\'t exactly secure).. \"Papers please\". i am a dum dum but if you have the vaccine can\\'t you still spread it?. So how the fuck do I get this?. Lol this is just an excuse to encourage vaccinations.. Not a bad idea. Please. \\n\\nI‚Äôve got family members who are skeptics of these new vaccines because they don‚Äôt fully understand how it works. \\n\\nBut to go to a ball game they‚Äôd absolutely be getting their shot.. Good!. Holy shit, judging by the number of down votes people are getting, looks like we have a bunch of tinfoil hatters here.. I don\\'t care.  I just want to get vaccinated and go to concert or some shit.. That was the attitude right after 9/11; don‚Äôt care, just want revenge. It‚Äôs how we ended up with the patriot act and an endless war. Have some patience and healthy skepticism. You‚Äôll get back to the bars and overpriced concerts soon enough.. hear hear. I got Pfizer #1 on 2/21. About 4 hours after getting the shot, I felt really tired and thought I‚Äôd take a nap but ended up sleeping until about 9pm. When I awoke, I felt really foggy and kind of run down, which is pretty much how the flu shot affects me. The next morning I was really groggy, and over the course of the day became damn near comatose with slight body aches... slight soreness at the injection site, but nothing to complain about. Ended up go to bed early, got up on the third day feeling a little run down, but that cleared up by mid day. Never had a headache or fever.. Dang! I‚Äôve definitely read a few responses about others feeling completely wiped out and sleeping too. I haven‚Äôt actually experienced any extra fatigue thankfully, but my other health conditions cause that symptom for me anyway. Glad you‚Äôre feeling better!. These cells are going to the garbage anyway. So instead they may have used them to develop a vaccine that saves lives and allows the economy to bounce back.. Actually that\\'s not necessarily the case here.  We aren\\'t dealing with tissue that would be otherwise destroyed.  The cells involved in the vaccines derive from a cell line that originated with a fetus that was aborted in the 70s.  Those cells are replicated for the purpose of scientific study.  That\\'s not to say that there isn\\'t an overwhelming need to vaccinate the country.  Just that the ethical issues here are tricky.  But we should be open about that, and deal with these issues now before they create hesitancy in the future.  To the bishops\\' credit, that is what they seem to be trying to do.. They say you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen and apply ice to the swollen area. But if you are in extreme pain I would go to the emergency room or whatever sort of facility that you have where you are. Also there should be a contact number for you to call regarding reactions.. I had this in both arms for about 8 hours after getting the Pfizer. I‚Äôm not sure what it was either! I‚Äôm generally pretty sensitive to side effects, so I wasn‚Äôt shocked but shit, it hurt! I used the heat pad, naproxen, and tried to lay so my arms were at my side and as relaxed as possible and that seemed to help.. I received the Moderna vaccine this morning. I didn\\'t even feel it when the nurse administered it. I have some soreness in my arm now seven hours later but other than that it\\'s been good. I have other friends that received the vaccine it said it made their arms sore and that they were sleepy and needed a nap. No one complained of a bad/painful stick.  And I usually take a daytime nap. And haven\\'t. LOL. I thought it hurt less than the flu shot and other vaccines I have had.  Don‚Äôt look and you will be fine. The apprehension is worse than the couple seconds it takes. Good luck!. Re your initial question: reach over and quickly pinch your upper arm. It hurts LESS than that to get the shot.  What happens after is different for everyone so that‚Äôs virtually impossible to predict.. It\\'s a very small needle.\\n\\nJust don\\'t look.. Oh and I took two Tylenol before I got the vaccine. So they may have it relieved my discomfort prophylactically.. Hello! I have a pretty severe needle phobia as well and I just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday. I‚Äôm not sure if these tips will be relevant to you, but I wanted to share them in case! \\n\\nIt only feels like a little, stinging poke and lasted no more than 5 seconds. If the pain aspect of needles bothers you, icing the spot or giving it a pinch right before are great ideas. You could also purchase a topical numbing cream/gel at any drugstore.\\n\\nFor me, it‚Äôs not about the pain, but about the needle being in my body. To combat this, I like to chat as casually as possible with the nurse about literally anything else... in this case she saw my 21st birthday was coming up, so I asked her if she had any recommendations for places that serve good drinks in our area. Anything will do, I just find that those conversations distract me from thinking about the needle for a few minutes before I get it. Some people have told me to tell the nurse about the fear, but honestly the ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù approach has been much more successful. I hope it goes well for you!. I think it‚Äôs more the actual shot that‚Äôs scaring me more than side effects. Thanks though, this helps a little.. I got my first Moderna shot today. Didn\\'t even feel it when the nurse gave it to me and have had no side effects not even a sore arm since. I had a Little tenderness at one time but it went away. I took 2 Tylenol  prophylactically, so I was ready for some discomfort. And I think most vaccines contain some sort of mRNA.\\nI can\\'t wait till I get the deck shot at the end of this month. And I hope my husband\\'s appointment comes through soon.. How do you know which vaccine you\\'re getting before you get to the vaccination site?. Random.  Both are highly effective and the sooner you can get a vaccine the better. \\nSource: oncology nurse. To quote the great Yogi Bera, when you reach a fork in the road, take it.  The differences between all the vaccines are nuanced.  But in particular, as between Pfizer and Moderna, both of which are mRNA vaccines, the difference is particularly small.  Ask yourself, if the risk from COVID is great enough to motivate you to get vaccinated, then why accept the risk of waiting a week and have the vaccine not be available?. I would get whichever was available and guaranteed first. I wanted Pfizer like you but would have taken either. I lucked out. Maybe you will too. But I know people that have had both and symptoms are identical. I wouldn‚Äôt risk waiting if you could lose out on it. Now if it was guaranteed you‚Äôd get Pfizer in a week I‚Äôd say wait and be careful for one extra week. But since you could lose out I‚Äôd go with the random one. Plus they both are same technology and same efficacy.. Can‚Äôt speak on Moderna, but I didn‚Äôt have any major symptoms from either shot of Pfizer.. They are both pretty similar. I would go for whichever you can get first. If you delay it there is always a chance you can catch covid before getting it.. Agree with others just get it as fast as you can. Mrna ones are much of a muchness and I would have gladly taken astra zeneca or J&amp;J. People who are better than me at maths can probably tell you the probability of catching covid while you wait for preferred vaccine outweighs any difference between vaccines. In other words the efficacy while you wait is 0%. Good luck! I had my first and it ended up being pfizer, had a mild allergic reaction as a v allergic person but am still getting the second dose... What is your reasoning for choosing one over the other? Some are waiting for the J&amp;J because they are scared of the new mrna platform, others are so afraid of getting shots that they can\\'t push themselves to get the 2nd one.. Unironically, Gameleya or Sinopharm.. I prefer Pfizer because of the less severe reported side effects.. Sorry if this is a personal question but are you on any disabilities lists? They\\'ve added them to high priority.. Did others at your University get the same text? There are two groups that we vaccinate first: Those that are most vulnerable to the virus and those that are most likely to spread the virus. University students, who are largely unaffected personally, are often spreaders.. You have been chosen.. Because science and logic died in March 2020. RIP.. I got a call on Saturday from my GP surgery asking me to attend today. I asked why, I‚Äôm mid 30‚Äôs with no underlying health conditions and have been working from home since last March. I said I must have been added to the list by accident and if they wanted to check and call me back I wouldn‚Äôt be annoyed. Didn‚Äôt want to take a vaccine from someone who needed it- they said to attend the appointment if I didn‚Äôt hear back from them. \\n\\nI didn‚Äôt get a call back, so I got the first dose this morning. No point it going to waste I guess. I do feel guilty though. I‚Äôm assuming there was some kind of systems error and I tried to get them to check, I know people at my surgery who are medically vulnerable and haven‚Äôt been called yet. Very strange. \\n\\nI‚Äôve heard this has happened to a few people as well.. Go away. You\\'re really not in any position to debate.. Coworker\\'s wife and neighbor\\'s friend tested POSITIVE after getting the Pfizer.\\n\\nCould be the batch or simply the cycle threshold of the tests though.  You can make anything test positive with a Ct &gt; 15.\\n\\nWho knows?. They ask you a series of questions before receiving the vaccine, including do you have any allergies. They will address that at that time.. Hey! How are you feeling now?. Hi, I\\'m doing okay still! My muscle soreness got worse at around 18hrs post-vaccination but I went to sleep at that time and woke up feeling a lot less sore. No more headaches at all so aside from soreness if I move my arm a certain way I have no other side effects right now. It\\'s been about 24hrs now. I\\'m curious if I\\'ll develop more side effect symptoms in the coming week since that seems to happen to some people.. I\\'m 6 days in on #2 and I have been fine except yesterday I started feeling a tooth ache maybe starting. Well now I have a tooth ache and am waiting until 9 to call my dentist. I\\'m sure it has no relation the the shot, but a pain none the less.. I‚Äôm 19 years old and got the first dose of Moderna last month (just got second dose today!) I was incredibly sick until day 7 after the first shot. Completely fine after that. Talked to the nurse today and they said people feel symptoms up to two weeks after the shot. Your dad is still in that time frame so I wouldn‚Äôt worry :). Keep 911 on speed dial.\\n\\nNot even joking.. Try some otc nausea meds like tums or pepto bismol.. He\\'s at work, the health department had someone check on him. A few times he wanted to take the day off but started feeling better as day went on. Today is 9 days post vaccine he is still feeling nausea.. No, anyone who gets the vaccine is a win! There are so many on waiting lists and are being called because there are no shows and the vax has to be used up or tossed. Be proud you got it and go back to get that second dose when it‚Äôs due. üôåüèª. I am also 41 and the vaccine was offered to me, and I got it.  I DO NOT FEEL GUILTY.  It crossed my mind that there are people that need it more than I do, but, by getting this vaccine we are helping prevent the spread to others.  Everyone (well almost everyone) will be getting it eventually, and it was offered to me, so yes I feel it was the responsible choice for me to go ahead and accept the offer.  I am grateful for the opportunity to help protect my community, my family and all others I come into contact with.\\n\\nBTW, I wouldn\\'t have taken the spot from someone else, but I was told I was eligible due to something in my medical records (not sure what?). Studies now indicate that the mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing transmission of COVID-19.  One more person who is less a risk of transmission helps everyone - including those who need the vaccine.  It matters that vulnerable populations get vaccinated.  But this is war of numbers, and beating this disease means getting as many people vaccinated as fast as possible.  Yours is another shot fired to win.. I understand why you feel bad, but you shouldn\\'t. Besides personal protection, once you reach a certain level then vaccinated people will help reach herd immunity. You are contributing to that.. Not at all. You did the right thing if others weren‚Äôt showing up. I would have done the same.. I mean you shouldn\\'t feel guilty. They didn\\'t check ID\\'s to see if everyone is 65 (I heard that\\'s common) and you didn\\'t take a vaccine from someone else because there were many slots, and the main goal is to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible.. In Austin there are more people willing to get the vaccine than there is vaccine. I am over 65 and would be willing to travel somewhere where there\\'s more vaccine than there are people willing to get it. I would have done the same thing if I was in your shoes. Don\\'t feel guilty.. not wasting doses is always a good thing. as long as you didn\\'t cheat and lie and/or buy yourself into the head of the line, you\\'re on the right side of fair play.. Same here Im 34 and felt the same way and if I ever tell anyone I received the vaccine they get mad and ask if I am a healthcare professional. This actually happened to me when I visited the dentist.. If your 41 they‚Äôd probably be able to tell your under 65 . If they weren‚Äôt bothered, why should u be :).  I am 41 and had been scheming to somehow get the vaccine before it\\'s open to everyone in my state. I finally had to accept today that it ain\\'t happening.\\n\\n But anyway, don\\'t feel guilty. If you can get it, get it.. I think you absolutely did the right thing.. No. Soon everyone will be vaccinated who wants it. But none of it should go to waste.. I‚Äôm (49) getting mine Friday and I feel a bit guilty as well. I technically work for a doctor‚Äôs office but I work from home now.  It‚Äôs being offered to our staff so I am able to get it.  I‚Äôm a bit nervous about getting it to be honest, but I‚Äôm being given an opportunity many wish to have so I‚Äôm grabbing it!. As someone who has a pre-existing condition in a state that has had a horrible roll-out, thank you for getting the vaccine. I was reading about the mindset of \"someone more deserving than me should get it\" leading to vaccine doses not being used, and ultimately dragging out time for more people who are at risk but have that mindset to get sick. I say if there are a lot of appointments and no takers, after making sure those who qualify have been contacted about them, anyone should get them. You getting a vaccine as a person in good health directly helps those who can\\'t get vaccines because of poor health!. Wish there were events like that in Virginia. I\\'ve been trying to get my high risk husband a vaccine for months and I keep being told he will be turned away if he\\'s not 65 and older. It took forever for me, a healthcare worker, to get my dose as they were prioritizing teachers. It makes me furious that it\\'s so inconsistent everywhere for the doses. Don\\'t feel guilty-if you got it, be freaking grateful.. Why feel guilty?\\n\\nYou are frontline cobayo!. Can you say what state you are in? In my state, we do not have enough vaccines. Long lines and waiting lists for limited spots. My state was hit very hard by this virus with many deaths (approx 25,000 deaths and almost a million infected) We are still suffering. I am a frontline HC worker and cannot get an appt for the vaccine. I am older than you. I\\'m just wondering how they allotted the distributed amount since you are saying no one showed up but in my state (my county, where I live is conservative but the state is very blue) we don\\'t have enough?. I‚Äôm 48 and I feel grateful. I got mine last week I‚Äôm a teacher with autoimmune disease.. Did you lie about your eligibility?\\n\\nI think if you did, you should absolutely feel guilty and we shouldnt be encouraging ANYONE to sign up if they dont qualify. I know people are saying \"but they were going to waste doses\" but lets be clear: open appointments dont always mean wasted doses. Open appointments just mean they can schedule someone. ONCE someone is scheduled and they know how many vaccinations that day, then they will take out vials. \\n\\nBut that means if you see an open appt and you sign up, theyre going to thaw a vial. And if it turns out that you dont qualify and they have to send you home, its a waste vial. so absolutely anyone should feel guilty about signing up for appts theyre ineligible for. Not only does it not help vaccine waste, it can cause it if they stick to their policy which most will. \\n\\nAnd people getting appointments is a HUGE ISSUE when they dont qualify. If you dont qualify, dont sign up guys. Please dont do it. Its not ethical, its not helping, it is jumping the line. \\n\\nWhat is ethical? Getting a leftover dose. leftover doses are going to be wasted and they should go in any arm. How can you get one? Ask about waitlists for leftover doses at the end of the day. If they call, you come in, you get one, great. No harm, no stealing, no causing waste.. you did the right thing if people are being silly and refusing it it would‚Äôve gone to waste anyways one less person who can spread the virus. Absolutely not. Anyone who can get the vaccine should get the vaccine. I had a chance to get vaccinated through my work. I am 53, in good health but exposed to anyone. I felt like I had imposter syndrome but am glad to be protected.. If you were in a group eligible to get the vaccine, there\\'s nothing to feel guilty about.  You\\'re not the one deciding who gets the shot when.  They say whenever you are first eligible to get the vaccine depending on whatever priority group you are in you should get it.. You\\'re wrong to ask reddit for ethical advice. You should not feel guilty. My entire family lucked out because we were in the right place at the right time. The rollout has not gone as planned in my state. People who want to protect themselves and help us on the way to herd immunity should not feel guilty. You did the right thing. The opportunities exist and many are turning it down. Good for you. Hope your life can get back to normalish soon üòä. Do not feel guilty. The end goal is to vaccinate nearly everyone anyway. Right now the most important thing is to get shots in arms and not let them expire in fridges. \\n\\nThank you for taking the opportunity and doing your part.. No, many vaccines had to be thawed that day and might not get used if you and others like you didn\\'t.  You\\'re fine. You didn\\'t take and appointment from anyone using a code you got online. That\\'s different. You were essentially filling a gap of customers.. Hey if nobody wanted it, then get yourself. WTH , no? You go! üëç. Nope. I am 51 and I volunteered at a POD vaccination sight in my city. At the end of my shift, I got the vaccine. The doctor I was working with who was administering the vaccines gave them to anyone and everyone in the car. He said we need to worry about getting shots in arms, not about who gets them.. Don‚Äôt feel guilty. It slows the spread, protects us all. The rollout in my state is a mess. Very organized for teachers, but under 70 sick people couldn‚Äôt get it. Indiana was open for 65plus a month before us if you worked there. My husband was able to get one dose &amp; they stopped work eligibility. I can almost see Indiana from my porch. When he went for the second, there was no one there &amp; they were a little too happy about purging people who didn‚Äôt live/ work there. They have many openings, so looks like plenty of vaccine. Rollout 60-70 this week in Ky. Walgreens website froze. Really what an awful healthcare system when we are going to Kroger &amp; Walmart for healthcare. I just want them to give them until they run out to anyone in front of them. Just do it.. You you should cos now you‚Äôve got a chip in you that means Bill Gates can see everything you‚Äôre doing plus your now infertile, contributing to his overpopulation solution. By getting the vaccine you have now let Bill Gates start his New World Order /s. You should feel guilty for posting about it.. Many older adults are living their final days indoors and alone. Many also don‚Äôt have access to technology. They deserve it first. My state is in a shortage and all of the young kids with technology are getting them first through rite aid. If you weren‚Äôt eligible then you should feel guilty. If you were eligible due to a chronic illness then youre okay. Spots fill up within seconds here.. No. Being selfish about your health is not shameful.. No you should mostly just feel stupid if you were aware of what\\'s going on right now. The vaccine\\'s not doing any good sitting in a fridge. It\\'s better off in your arm than in a vial.. I felt guilty. But I figured that if people wanted them they would have gotten them if they were in the two groups especially in small conservative areas like mine.. No one needs this vax. Why are you on this site if your aren‚Äôt interested in the vaccine? Maybe try visiting another sub that appeals to your interests?. No one needs to die ether when a vaccine can prevent it. Please educate yourself before making ignorant comments.. Did you happen to have Covid previously? I heard the first dose can be worse for individuals who already had COVID-19.. for me the soreness went away after the 2nd day. Just got my first Phizer jab about 4.5 hours ago, no symptoms thus far. Others I know who got it said they had a sore arm for a day or so and that the 2nd shot was when they developed a fever and felt like crap. Still, it definitely can happen with the first shot as well. It\\'s a sign it\\'s working, so that\\'s good. Hope you feel better, you did the right thing by getting the vaccine. Better to feel bad a little bit than deal with full bore Covid.. This doesn‚Äôt help for your current pain, but you can do it for the next one: my friend gave me the tip to move my arm a ton after my first shot (raise it, turn it, reach, shift it forward and back, etc) like every 5 minutes, and I did that and the soreness was greatly diminished after one day and nonexistent the second morning I woke up. She did not do this with her first shot and was very sore for 3-4 days. She did it with her second and was good after 1.5.. thats how i felt when i got covid. My mothers the exactly same. She couldn‚Äôt move all day after getting the vaccine cause her arm was hurting like shit. No previous COVID, either. I honestly feel so bad, she‚Äôs out there on the front line and when she gets something that‚Äôs supposed to PROTECT HER, it fucking disables her for a day. I got my Pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and ran a fever the second day. Tylenol helped, I recommend taking something for the fever. \\n\\nI\\'m mostly having trouble with lethargy, fatigue, and now low blood pressure on day 2 (dizzy, light headed when standing up like before one faints). Mostly bedridden. I\\'m not overweight, exercise several times a week including cardio, in my 30s.\\n\\nNever had covid previously like another commenter mentions (I\\'ve been isolated at home, grocery delivery, no fraternizing with friends, neighbors, or family, no restated, etc since a year ago.)\\n\\nI\\'m also worried about the second dose since it\\'s supposed to be worse.. Please be sure to report your symptoms to VAERS Adverse Event Reporting:\\n\\n[https://vaers.hhs.gov/](https://vaers.hhs.gov/). Same. Can\\'t lift my arm much but putting a warm compress then cold compress helped.. I‚Äôm day 9 out from my first Pfizer shot and I still have some muscle pain and fatigue. Pretty substantial the first 7 days, now slowly getting better.. That‚Äôs good news, this soreness is brutal!. ###[Meta] Sticky Comment\\n\\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \\n\\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\\n\\n*What this means*: Please keep any \"meta\" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\\'t know anything about the reliability of the study or journal, but I firmly believe vitamin D deficiency and lack of exposure to the unsterilized real world from a young age is the root cause of the declining health of the masses.. I take vitamin d everyday.. Get your sunlight boys and girls! üåû. Makes me glad I‚Äôm already on a Vitamin D supplement due to working nights and not getting enough sunlight.. SS: why isn‚Äôt Fauci and other ‚Äúexperts‚Äù\\n not pushing people to take Vitamin D supplements and get outside more? Oh that‚Äôs right, they can‚Äôt make loads of money off a supplement. They‚Äôd rather push an experimental vaccine instead of promoting healthy living. I‚Äôve been telling everyone this I can for months now. Make sure you are taking Vitamin D and Zinc!. Great now let‚Äôs keep everyone on house arrest.  Its been know for what -- 100 years now fresh air, sunshine, simple walking few times a week or outdoor activities are great for you.. Who wants to bet OP didn‚Äôt read this study?. OP thank you for posting this.   \\nFor those who are/were paying attention,  \\n\\n\\nEXPERTS WERE TALKING ABOUT VITAMIN D ALL LAST YEAR AND FOR YEARS PRIOR!  \\nThis is not new but is INCREDIBLY important for everyone to remember. Don\\'t let them memory hole you.  \\nYou have an immune system but it requires maintenance like everything else.   \\nTHE SUN IS A GREAT SOURCE OF VITAMIN D.  \\nWe have positive temperatures today where I am, sun is just beaming. Probably go for a nice long hike by the lake. Take in that fancy new thing they call vitamin d.. Yeah this has been known since before the lock downs last year.. Ive been telling people this and getting downvoted to hell in other subs.. You guys, I\\'m in Minnesota and the last 2 weeks it was around -20¬∞\\n\\nYesterday it was 40¬∞ and everyone was outside in their sweaters smiling at each other. It\\'s a heat wave! üòÇ. ‚ÄúAccount for‚Äù and ‚Äúbe found in‚Äù are two very different things.. Sample size of 185 extrapolated to the whole population....\\nAlso this isn\\'t even a study, its a commentary on one result found.\\n\\nNo one should use this source to form an opinion.\\n\\nNot saying there\\'s not a link but this doesn\\'t help. I don\\'t have a stake in this, but I read the \"study\" and it\\'s trash. Purely correlational, and based on very limited set of patients. It controls for only 3 potential confounders (age, sex, and presence of comorbidity) -- there\\'s countless other confounders that could be (and likely are) at play here. This is so stupid. Vitamin D deficiency is not a deadly illness. It‚Äôs a completely benign condition when there isn‚Äôt a deadly virus going around. It would be like if some deadly virus were killing people who have poor eyesight. No one would say anything dumb like ‚Äúpoor eyesight may account for 90% of deaths‚Äù. We need to lock everyone in so they don‚Äôt get sunlight.. The fact that they brainwash the masses into thinking the sun is going to kill them speaks for itself.. This is not a conspiracy nor a conspiracy theory.. *Joe Rogan has joined the chat*. 6,000 IU of Vitamin D daily keeps the body healthy.. I got plenty of Vitamin D for any ladies out there that require some. Whether this is the case or not, the last thing people should be doing is bottling up. Your immune system is coming apart without regular exposure. Not to mention everyone who has become more sedentary. Which leads to simple issues like lumbar lordosis (lower back pain you can fix by stretching, which is very common for people who sit a lot), or more serious issues like obesity and heart disease.. The amount of times I saw \"health professionals\" talk about distancing, lockdowns and mask just to never mention vitamin D astonishes me. makes sense tbh. Deadly serious question: what is the diff btwn D and D3?. I\\'m male over 50 and I take 700 IU vitamin D a day, is that enough?. Except 9 out of 10 people have vitamin D deficiency anyways....... If it is true, Brings a whole new meaning to stay inside.. I have been watching Dr. John Campbell (in the UK) on YT since Feb 2020. He has been advising a high daily dose of vitamin D for much of that time. \\n\\nI wonder why information released is so fragmented and inconsistent.. Which is ironic since we are told to stay at home. Oh you mean to tell me telling people to stay home and only leave for essential needs was a bad thing? That seniors in nursing homes who don\\'t go outside often were going to be affected really bad?. The water is full of fluoride and who knows what else. The food supply is screwed up (GMO, hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, livestock fed Skittles, etc,), our medicines don\\'t solve underlying problems but cause new ones. Our cleaning supplies and grooming products contain hormone disruptors. Our plastics are causing estrogen dominance. The push to go meatless and stay out of the sun is counter to how we evolved. Our doctors can\\'t prescribe simple natural cures, but are incentivized to push pharmaceuticals and penalized if they don\\'t.\\n\\nI used to think this was chaotic. Now I think it\\'s an organized poisoning of the population by the elites for fun and profit.. I told my 70 year old parents to take vitamin D back in March of last year. \\n\\nBut the Democrat media wouldn‚Äôt report that, they were too busy hating Trump.. I said that Vitamin D and C + pain killer + antibiotics all on an intravenous treatment to cure from covid-19 around a year ago because I got this in South Korea and I got massivelly downvoted thats why I made this new username hahaha but anyways how about now?!. LMAO....what?????????. I get it bro you hate r/conspiracy so you can wrap your mind around how this is possible! Im sure you will google about this and find all the intentional bogus studies done on it! Like how studies done in america intentionally give bolus doses of vitamin d and then claim it has no effect! Im sure you will realize the only legitimate tests are done out of this country. ###[Meta] Sticky Comment\\n\\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does not apply*** when replying to this stickied comment.  \\n\\n[Rule 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_2_-_address_the_argument.3B_not_the_user.2C_the_mods.2C_or_the_sub.) ***does apply*** throughout the rest of this thread.\\n\\n*What this means*: Please keep any \"meta\" discussion directed at specific users, mods, or /r/conspiracy in general in this comment chain ***only.***\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Out of the 600 black men in the Tuskegee experiment, 399 ALREADY had syphilis at the beginning of the \"study\". The government did not GIVE them the disease. The government scientist withheld penicillin and were extremely unethical in the withholding of information and lies about the real purpose of the \"study\" and didn\\'t give a rat\\'s ass to intervene and watched them deteriorate. It was an atrocity by any measure, but not nearly as atrocious as them GIVING them syphilis.. They covered it very decently on here https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2421410/. They didn\\'t bring them in to \"cure\" said syphilis. They already had the cure they actually just injected them with syphilis, didnt let them know how it spreads, then watched them die slowly.

This is to be compared to the  0.19 per 100000 dying from COVID-19 and that are not vaccinated in that  age group, as per the above table. Hence the death rate of this age  group increased by 260 during this 5-week period of the vaccination  process, as compared to their natural COVID-19 death rate.\\n\\nI fail to see how 0.05% is significantly above the natural death rate for this age group or why it\\'s alarming. The natural death rate is going to be above the death rate caused exclusively by covid for this age group.\\n\\nThe true conspiracy to look for in my eyes is who has something to gain by pushing this absolute nonsense to the masses..

There are long term effects as well, which will take decades to surface, such as concerns with fertility, which now more than half their population will contend with.

Submission - The conspiracy theorists are being proven right once again, the injections are more dangerous than the virus, no doubt all part of an intentional eugenics program to reduce the numbers for UN Agenda 2030.. Given not every single vial of vaccine is tested before being administered, no one can truly and scientifically say they even know what was injected. A small sample would have to be examined for each and every vial to confirm exactly what is being injected. The only other option is to blindly \"trust\" that they put a \"safe vaccine dose\" in each and every vial.. LOL at the blatantly misleading title.\\n\\nIt was an analysis of the Israeli Health ministry data by someone in France and the analysis which claims they may be underreporting deaths.\\n\\nThis is just blatant disinformation..

Summary of information from the AMA (source below): The pandemic slows down as we reach herd immunity through a combination of infection and vaccination. Experts estimate that, based on how contagious COVID-19 is, about 70% of the population would need to be immune for herd immunity to be effective. Keep in mind as well that none of the vaccines are 100% effective.

See my comment here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVaxxers/comments/kwt3x4/scientifically\\\\_proven\\\\_verified\\\\_and\\\\_established/gj6cdn1?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVaxxers/comments/kwt3x4/scientifically_proven_verified_and_established/gj6cdn1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\\n\\nI point out the total lack of sources, and several demonstrably false and implausibly claims, I think OP is an antivaxer tryign to make pro vaxxers look dumb. Oh good, you\\'re back. Missed your very subtle antivaxx comments.. tldr; \"I will feel confident and grateful when finally it will be my turn to be inoculated. I will do it not only for myself but also for my loved ones and for every other person out there.\". This article is weird. I am also allergic to penicillin. I wouldn‚Äôt know how the Covid vaccine would have anything to do with that. Did not cross my mind at all.. This article really seems to just be asking what ifs and then he comes to the conclusion that if you can be vaccinated, you should be. I don‚Äôt know why the covid vaccine would contain penicillin, so unless you do have atopy, there wouldn‚Äôt be any reason to be worried.. It shouldn\\'t be a problem unless like me you are mildly suffering from atopy. Stay safe and get vaccinated, as it\\'s worth the risk.. How did you go about being in the trials?. They had a web site that asked about 10 basic questions and it told you if you qualified for the trial.  If you qualified then they said they would call you for your first appointment which lasts 3 or 4 hours.  There is a trial search site online.  \\n\\nThey filled up the one I‚Äôm in for J&amp;J, but opened a second one for a 2 shot version - my wife is getting her first shot in that trial tomorrow.\\n\\nYou also get paid, I‚Äôve gotten $260 so far, $150 for first visit.. Should not take Pfizer. No one should be vaccinated twice until all have been vaccinated.. I\\'d recommend to first see what IgG sars cov 2 antibody count they have, rather than just havr another vaccine. Why waste a vaccine if the antibody titre is protective?. Please don\\'t. If you get your father vaccinated twice, that is denying someone else\\'s father to get vaccinated at all. I understand the concern. But don\\'t be selfish. \\n\\nMaybe get his antibody levels tested for reassurance and definitely wait until everyone else has had a chance to get the vaccine before doubling up. There are many of us that are still on strict lock down and barely getting through each day as we pray that our high-risk loved ones can get the shot before catching the disease that would probably kill them.. This is astonishingly selfish. Leave the Pfizer vaccine to others if he is already vaccinated. Consider him extremely lucky for getting the Chinese one in the first place.. How do I check that? Please advise.. I loved this clip for one big reason, the cap is still on the needle.... If your needle was the width of a Boba straw perhaps.\\n\\nAnd why 5G? Why wouldn\\'t you use 4G or 3G, hell - even 2G is still used by trackers you buy on Chinese websites.\\n\\nAntennas need certain lengths to transmit particular frequencies, and need power.\\n\\nNo, you\\'re not fitting a power source, or a means of getting power from the body or radio waves, into something that a needle can inject. Or a transmitter.\\n\\nAlthough, while you\\'re getting your vaccine, a hacker in the next room could hack your phone so it transmitted your location to whoever you want :)\\n\\nSeriously, if anyone is worried about body-trackers and still carries a phone, they are truly insane.  I mean, they\\'re probably not tracking you much even with your phone for anything other than delivering you ads, but still.. Biologically possible? Sure. Technically possible? No.. Even the smallest computers will cause a blood clot. There are much easier ways to track you. You are essentially carrying a location tracking device in your pocket for most parts of your day. Why still worry about trivial things like 5G implants. Do your research and not on Google.  Yes it is possible. The point is that a 5G implant doesn‚Äôt exist, isn‚Äôt trivial and can‚Äôt be injected with a vaccine needle. Damn, she had me going.. A for trolling.\\n\\nI hope there are many contenders vying for an A+.. Tell them you don\\'t want their FREE candy or gift cards to take the vaccine. Dude this is a Wendy\\'s. i just created a website w anonymous survey. i didn‚Äôt publish it yet bc i don‚Äôt have clinician support. i‚Äôm a healthcare data analyst. i want to track the side effects of the vaccines.  please contact me if you can. the website will be www.mycovidvaccinestory.com.. the websites not up yet. but i can put it up tonight and maybe you can help me design better survey questions. we could drive traffic to the site..  \\n\\nA study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.\\n\\n‚ÄúPeople didn\\'t like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn\\'t understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,‚Äù Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.\\n\\nExperts say, there‚Äôs work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.\\n\\n‚ÄúThere\\'s a lot of work that has to be done to ensure that the vaccines that come forward that we trust in them, that we trusted the science was done right,‚Äù Besser said after months of whiplashed messaging -- and years of systemic inequality. ‚ÄúA casualty of that approach is trust.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄúI think it\\'s okay to be scared,‚Äù ABC Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton said. ‚ÄúIt\\'s okay to acknowledge that - it means you\\'ve been paying attention. But in medicine and science, we have to go on facts, not fear.‚Äù. r/antivax: *exists*\\n\\nkurzgesagt:\\nI am about to Ã∂eÃ∂Ã∂nÃ∂Ã∂dÃ∂Ã∂ Ã∂Ã∂tÃ∂Ã∂hÃ∂Ã∂iÃ∂Ã∂sÃ∂Ã∂ Ã∂Ã∂mÃ∂Ã∂aÃ∂Ã∂nÃ∂Ã∂sÃ∂Ã∂ Ã∂Ã∂wÃ∂Ã∂hÃ∂Ã∂oÃ∂Ã∂lÃ∂Ã∂eÃ∂Ã∂ Ã∂Ã∂cÃ∂Ã∂aÃ∂Ã∂rÃ∂Ã∂eÃ∂Ã∂eÃ∂Ã∂rÃ∂Ã∂ discuss with this man. I appreciate kurzegzat (however it is spelled) for emphasizing the fact that even though vaccines are harmful to a select few, it is overwhelmingly better for vaccines to be enforced to protect the larger majority.\\n\\nAnd I appreciate you, OP, for sharing this to expand the knowledge of others.\\n\\nFor any anti-vaxxers on Reddit (if they even exist), Just because there is something online, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s true. I can spend 2 years of my life, cherry picking data and make the best video explaining how vaccines are dangerous. Those cases are extreme and almost never happen, or happen due to hereditary issues not relating to vaccines. There is nothing wrong with vaccines for the most part, just check if you are allergic or have mutations in your DNA that can affect you in the future. GO KURZGESAGT!. Vaccines save lives. I love that channel, they keep it legit. Sucks that they seriously have to tell people to just vaccinate their fucking kids tho. You know being an anti-vacc is gods plan\\n\\n\\n\\nI mean it\\'s a way for idiots to not have offsprings. Hey to all the stupid flat earther anti-vaxxer soccer mums! \\nI had parents who was againts vaccines and thought it caused autism, until they found out that despite not being vaccinated, I still had autism. \\nThat whole event caused my parents to rethink and found out the real truth about vaccines.. Side effects include: immunity to certain diseases, longer life, and a healthier body. Take vaccines only once every few months or so. Do not take vaccines while smoking or operating machinery. If you are antivax and you know it, clap your hands.. It‚Äôs risk is a long life you total buffoons. I was just about to hop into this thread to post the same video, Good work!. I watched this its great. I love this video! Thanks for sharing!!!! üòùüòù. I think the problem here is the risk of injury vs the risk of potential disease infection. Risk of getting a vaccine injury is extremely low, whereas the risk of contracting a debilitating disease is high without vaccinations. We\\'ve seen this with measles already, and people who were anti-vaxx before are now vaccinating because they realize that \"shit, my kid will become injured if I DON\\'T vaccinate.\" I mean, if you have a 50% chance of contracting measles from an infected people (don\\'t know the real stats, but let\\'s assume it\\'s at least 30%), and a 0.001% chance of getting a vaccine injury, I\\'d hella take the risk with the vaccine. And no, the argument that measles isn\\'t debilitating doesn\\'t fly. It is a bad disease, period.. At least my kids made it past 4. Anti-vaxxers are the kind of people that throw kids off bridges because the bridge might fall.. Was going to find an antivax thread and post this. Glad to see it already has been done.. This whole subreddit is retarded and so are the people who believe that you shouldn\\'t vaccinate your kids. All I have to say about not vaccinating is: Are you a doctor? If you are a doctor, and are still antivax, then  you are unqualified. My husband is obsessed with these videos. He saw this one and we discussed it at length.. Thought this sub was a joke... didn‚Äôt think people with this level of brain damage could operate a pc. Child of an anti vaxxer: chokes on food slightly\\n\\nAnti vaxxer: I‚Äôm not letting my kid eat food because that‚Äôs dangerous. remember to credit\\n\\n This is kurgezats vid \\n\\ncheck him out.  So, we vaccinated 10 million kids. üòÇ. Basically very very small. ^small. Watch the video you faggot. Vaccine good. How do you share video on reddit. People who are anti Vax aren\\'t very smart.. One of my only arguments with this is to ask if they remember having smallpox. Smallpox was eradicated due to the vaccine.. Fuck anti vaxers. Anti vaxxers, are people who couldn\\'t afford the abortion.. Anti-vaxxers: Exist\\nKurzgesagt: Hold my nutshell. This destroys AntiVaxx... I literally came here to post that video but you did thanks mate xD.. How Do Vaccines cause autism? If i get no response then they dont cause it.  In the 2000s, the pharma company Questcor started raising the price of  Acthar, an off-patent, 1950s-era drug prescribed for seizures in babies;  they raised the price more than 10,000%, from $40 in 2000 to $38,892  today. To get doctors to prescribe their price-gouging meds, Questcor  secretly offered bribes, a fact that came to light thanks to  whistleblowers.  REPEAT over and over...............................................This is  just  a single example...Do \\'Vax\" supporter REALLY think that drug corps care?. I was bitten by a dog once, so all dogs bite. That\\'s the dumb-ass logic you are presenting. No one is saying that drug companies are the second coming of Buddha. We are however, saying that vaccines work and are generally affordable and for the common good. I can find examples of every broad institution doing something shady, but that does not mean that all institutions are, or that they only do shady shit.\\n\\nSo grow up and join the adults.. Well that\\'s interesting. I just learned a lot about exactly how fetal tissues used in vaccine production. Neat.. The AFPAC/CPAC crowd has infested Catholic Churches, unfortunately. Hopefully this will help.. Your look just screams intelligence.. here is our first and second posts:\\n\\n1- [https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/lsvxzk/here\\\\_understand\\\\_this\\\\_should\\\\_help\\\\_with\\\\_teaching/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/lsvxzk/here_understand_this_should_help_with_teaching/)\\n\\n2- [https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/lv880j/the\\\\_next\\\\_lesson\\\\_for\\\\_antivaxxers\\\\_prepare\\\\_to\\\\_learn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivax/comments/lv880j/the_next_lesson_for_antivaxxers_prepare_to_learn/). This one will take you lot down once and for all. I\\'d like to personally thank everyone for the continued support for bodinson and this series. In thanks to this support, bodinson will be performing a anti-anti-vax rap named \"the jab\". This is all thanks to you guys!. Man this guy has a whole cadre of minions who worship him ü§§üòÇüòÜ‚òùÔ∏è. He\\'s bodinson, what do you expect?. jokes you you, the minions are cool af. That poor, poor kid. \\n\\nStage Mum and an anti vaxxer. Then she\\'ll be blaming him when he never gets any work.. What did you say about a vaccine? this is out of context. I ask that my actors (most of whom will be grown adults) either present a recent negative COVID test or evidence of vaccination to work on my project. I know that kids can\\'t receive the vaccine yet, but the fact that she refuses to even test her child should raise some eyebrows.. I‚Äôm not an expert in vaccines, but I do know a thing or two about talking to antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Don‚Äôt get bogged down in making broad claims about vaccines as a whole, because then all it takes is one loophole to ‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù your entire argument. She isn‚Äôt an antivaxxer, so the last thing you want to do is to send her down the rabbit hole (which is a *very* slippery slope.) You aren‚Äôt talking about all vaccines here, you‚Äôre talking about a literal handful of vaccines in particular, so focus on the specifics of the COVID vaccines. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs been a fair bit of misinformation going around on Instagram / Facebook, including what appear to be fake screen shots warning of fertility impacts, but as far as I can tell they‚Äôre just that: fake. The EUAs and information for prescribers and recipients for each vaccine are public, and while there is some language about birth defects etc. the context is important because it‚Äôs specifically regarding what legally must be reported to VAERS with *any* vaccine ‚Äî not evidence of side effects ‚Äî and the prevalence of pregnancy-related issues in all people, vaccinated or not. The EUAs also include fun information like the fact that only 0.3% of recipients in the trial had any sort of adverse reaction (swelling, pain, etc.), but also that 0.2% of people who got the *placebo* reported the same side effects. \\n\\nThe other reason you don‚Äôt want to start citing other vaccines is that the COVID vaccines (in particular the Modern and Pfizer ones) *are* somewhat new technology. It‚Äôs totally normal and OK to be nervous about that, but despite the misinformation, it‚Äôs not as scary as it sounds. No, they don‚Äôt modify your DNA ‚Äî they use modified RNA (different than DNA) as a vector to ‚Äúteach‚Äù your body how to recognize the characteristic protein spike of COVID-19 and manufacture the antibody ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt at all unlike how traditional vaccines that use a dead virus work. There‚Äôs also this idea floating around that it isn‚Äôt even a vaccine because it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting infected. While it‚Äôs true that there isn‚Äôt proof that they prevent infection, they do prevent the virus from replicating and creating symptoms, and that‚Äôs literally one of the ways that some traditional vaccines operate (search term: therapeutic vaccine). They‚Äôve also shown to be almost 100% effective in eliminating serious cases ‚Äî that ‚Äú95%‚Äù number you see floating around is very misleading because it‚Äôs looking at all cases ‚Äî including totally asymptomatic ones or ones that amount to the sniffles (the vast majority). It *might* not stop the virus from getting into your body, but it *will* make you drastically less likely to get sick from it. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs no evidence I can find of reproductive effects from any of the COVID vaccines ‚Äî but there *is* evidence of reproductive effects from getting a symptomatic case COVID virus. \\n\\nThe most important thing in all of this though isn‚Äôt the information ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you communicate with her. ‚ÄúHow to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äù is, IMO, a terribly overrated book that everyone should read because the core tenants are spot on. The best way to win an argument is not to have one. Empathize with her, listen to her, and don‚Äôt preach, criticize or shun. I‚Äôve spent more hours than I can count purposefully spelunking into the QAnon / anti-vaccine rabbit hole (along with most other conspiracy theories) and it‚Äôs definitely one of the most dangerous ones I‚Äôve come across for the amount of brain power it takes to parse out and refute the various claims. I‚Äôm naturally an information junky who‚Äôs skeptical of literally everything and actually enjoys and does this kind of thing professionally, and while I might have more of a natural immunity to it than some, I don‚Äôt fault people for falling down the rabbit hole. The way they twist / misuse information is *masterful.* \\n\\nOof, that was a lot more long-winded and rambly than I intended.  Sorry. \\n\\nIf you want to show her information, I‚Äôd stick to the primary sources like the EUAs because it‚Äôs harder to just say ‚Äúfake news‚Äù (or whatever), but if you want some background info for yourself there‚Äôs a great podcast called ‚ÄúConspirituality‚Äù that touches on this stuff from a hippie wellness perspective, and on the flip side Ron Bailey over at Reason Magazine has done some great reporting on this stuff. He‚Äôs consistently had some of the most clear-headed and level takes since the beginning of the pandemic. \\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\n(BTW, it‚Äôs ‚Äúaffect‚Äù in this case. The best way to remember it is think ‚Äúa‚Äù for ‚Äúaction.‚Äù An affect is an action, and an effect is a thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs some tricky exceptions, but TBH it‚Äôs not worth worrying about. Just use that rule and 99.5% of the time you‚Äôll be correct, and if you‚Äôre wrong only 0.1% of people or so will notice anyway).. Show her the inserts they put inside of the vaccine boxes, they should have them laying around at any vaccine center. Not an informative bulletin board copied piece of paper they might hand out. The actual inserts. It should be a small piece of paper folded up quite a bit. In it will detail risks to reproductive harm, if any, and whatever else.. A picture I keep seeing floating around Facebook is about the trials recommending not trying to get pregnant or something like that (it‚Äôs been a while since I read it). People are saying that it‚Äôs due to fertility issues. But during the 1st few rounds of trails they don‚Äôt want pregnant women as they don‚Äôt know any affects. Which the OB people fought for pregnant women to have the choice due to the accidental pregnancies during trails and stuff. They can also start collecting the data to make sure it‚Äôs safe as most medications for pregnant women will get a safety rating. So if the benefits outweigh the chances side effects they‚Äôll do it. \\n\\nDon‚Äôt quote me but I believe tamiflu is like a C rating but if a doctor feels they‚Äôre having a harder time with the flu that the medication is more beneficial then harmful. \\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry I kinda started rambling and totally left the topic at hand.. The vaccine is so new that it does not meet FDA approval criteria, and is only allowed under an emergency use authorization, [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/index.html) any new drug or vaccine may have unforeseen side effects, and fertility effects are something that would take time to show up, however there is no particular evidence of an effect on fertility from this vaccine\\n\\nNot all vaccines are the same, and there have been vaccines that were discovered to have serious side effects only after they had been in use, this happened with both of the  swine flu scares  [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html)\\n\\n[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/history/narcolepsy-flu.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/history/narcolepsy-flu.html) although the side effects were still not common\\n\\nHowever, you cannot use the fact that an existing vaccine is safe to say a new one must also be safe\\n\\nAlso, long term effects of covid itself are unknown, so this also has to be taken into acocunt\\n\\nMost teens are not even eligible to get vaccinated yet\\n\\nEDIT: Can the people downvoting me tell me what they think I\\'m wrong about?. Its affecting :). \"Effect\" as a verb means to cause or bring about.\\n\\n\"Affect\" means to cause a change in something. That\\'s the one you probably wanted, although effecting teen fertility is not necessarily a good thing either.. I √†m extremely pro-vax, but I don\\'t like the COVID vaccine. 3 reasons ; my country\\'s gouvernement clearly said it didn\\'t protect you from the covid, only protected you from the aggravated effects of the virus. 2nd of all, the vaccine is very recent so we may not know the problems of it yet. Maybe it gives out a deadly disease, but only after a year? It might not, but it can have negative side effects still not discovered. To finish, since we already know it gives out side effects, I do not see the utility of the doing the vaccine as a healthy human being. If you are in a very bad health position, it can be a good idea to vaccinate yourself, but if you are in a respectable enough range for the virus not to cause severely negative effects on you, the vaccine is not necessary, since it doesn\\'t protect you 100%, the only thing you will get is a bunch of weird side effects. I think we need to wait for the vaccine to advance in years to know its true side effects list.\\nNow this is just my opinion, you can have a different one.. Is there evidence on the longterm effects of Covid-19 vaccines in teens?. Why do they need the vaccine? We already know it‚Äôs probably not gonna help with transmission üòÇü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è.

How are you this stupid. Jesus, could the anti-vax community not send out someone better. Or are you somehow the best and brightest.. sub is meant to be satirical, but many antivax people don\\'t have brains big enough to understand that.. This is very much for satirical and/or memes involving anti vax people, mainly used for making fun of their illogical logic behind not supporting vaccines. In the sidebar it even includes info on why vaccines work.. Read the sidebar.. its pro vaxx. for anit vaxxers go to r/DebateVaccines. While it is meant to be anti-vax (in a satirical fashion), there are real anti-vaxers on here occasionally.. yes. Here\\'s a real anti vaxxer for yas!!! Stay up to date folks...thin the herd so my family and I have more room to breathe!!! Thx. Gotcha stupid antivaxer. I‚Äôm a pro vaxxer. I mean it is a problem for some, I\\'m terrible in social situations and high school was a twisting hell.  But at least I\\'m not dead from a highly preventable disease.  Vaccines didn\\'t cause my autism, I came out that way ( my parents were on the older side when I was born).. Of course Autism is a problem for some. You\\'re doing a strawman-people are saying most antivaxxers exaggerate autism-i.e. the one who said\"Id rather my child be dead than autistic\". Thats an extreme examples but in general they hyperbolize autism. People clarifying that autism doesnt make you a carrot doesnt mean they dont understand that autism can be a bad thing.. Because there are a lot of autistic people we have to blame for a lot of important and huge franchises such as Pok√©mon, if autism was such a huge problem then it would be extensively researched and attempts to find a cure would be all over the place. Plus, it isn‚Äôt injected into people, they are born with it through genetics. Autism is not a problem is used often because IT IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM, the bigger issue is the fact that these parents choose to keep their children unprotected from preventable diseases and viruses that CAN lead to life long short comings such as mumps causing infertility and other such examples which in return, causes strained relationships with their parents and can lead to a decrease in population in general. Eradicated viruses are eradicated because of vaccines and should stay that way, not be rampant like the Black Death was in Europe, in fact that virus still exists but now that we have a cure for it (provided you find assistance in less than a day) it can no longer cause major deaths and huge losses especially because the virus lingers on a persons body. I don‚Äôt like arguing with something as simple as keeping your children safe using a method every educated person agrees with but apparently, common sense isn‚Äôt as common as it‚Äôs name would suggest.. Autism has nothing to do with vaccines, and has been repeatedly proven again and again.\\n\\nThus, when discussing safety of vaccines,  autism indeed is not a problem.\\n\\nBecause it is absolutely unrelated to the issue, and should be treated as such.. Once you say autism is a problem, you start to see people argue to \"cure\" or \"eradicate\" it, as if it\\'s a disease. Following that train of thought further can lead to eugenics.\\n\\nOr at least, that\\'s my understanding of the situation.. Because science?. Because autism is not a disease but rather a disorder that don\\'t stop anyone from living a productive live? I mean come on now! This entire point you made is not much of saying that \"homosexuality is a choice because it\\'s unnatural to which... no because one it is NOT a choice and two it\\'s isn\\'t unnatural\". They\\'re absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic and it nothing to be ashamed about as I knew many who\\'s able to live a healthy and happy life. Sure, it\\'s hard to adjust but it\\'s possible plus just because you have a bad or stressful experience doesn\\'t mean the entire argument should be dismiss but rather it could be due to lack of awareness or understanding about autism or it\\'s that you live in a neighborhood that don\\'t care. The fact is that there nothing wrong with being autistic and it\\'s baffling that you claimed to not be against vaccines but yet your comments lately said otherwise.. I would not use the argument like that perosnally. The main point is that vaccines do not cause autism in the first place. I think people say it only to people claiming it causes autism as an example. If for some reason all those studies turn out to be false or did not exist and vaccines did cause autism like these people claim, would that really be so bad that you would not vaccinate your child? If everybody stops vaccinating the chances of getting ill will become much higher bc right now unvaccinated people profit off of herd immunity. \\n\\nIf all those studies that prove vaccines do not cause autism did not exist and the only one that does was not debunked, it should still not be worth the risk of your kid getting an easy preventable disease just bc of a risk of autism. People with autism can live a happy live, can live on their own, can often have a job. A bad case of measles can cause permanent hearing loss, but most dangerous: pneumonia which can lead to death. \\n\\nI think this is the reasoning behind the argument. I still think it should not be used bc vaccines don\\'t cause autism in the first place.. If vaccines actually had a chance to cause autism, It would be the same as wondering why we see the possibility of soreness, bruises and broken bones as an acceptable \"side effect\" for driving with our seat belts on.\\n\\nOut of context, it wouldn\\'t be acceptable for anyone to end up sore, bruised or with broken bones under any normal circumstances.\\n\\nWithin context though, it isn\\'t a problem for most *because the alternative can often mean serious injury or even death.*\\n\\nIf you don\\'t understand how important \"context\" is in a discussion such as this, I\\'m starting to think that you\\'re purposefully playing daft.. What I\\'m talking about are the people who say that autism isn\\'t even a bad thing, no just that it is better than risking serious infectious disease, in you seatbelt analogy this would be like someone who says broken bones are harmless. 3 to 4? Wow they must be really rich. Are you trying to say this sub is an antivax subreddit? Or are you just making fun of antivaxers?  \\n\\n\\nIf the first one, this is a pro vax subreddit..

Hello! I privately know Pfizer by a very near relative, there are studies and Pfizer in their site publish all the news related to their vaccine and COVID-19.\\n(www.pfizer.com/health/coronavirus/updates)\\n\\n\\nThe vaccine has shown a 95% effectivity preventing COVID-19, also, dealing with the virus by yourself will not increase ur inmunity against it, in fact, it is more dangerous bc u can lose ur sense of smelling, and end with slightly damaged lungs (i think) and there is the possibility of ending in the ICU because of complications. Is much safer inoculating ourself, why? You are not injecting yourself the virus, only a copy of the protein spike of the virus, not the inactivated virus, is important to know that the vaccine will not manipulate your DNA. To summarize a little, the against naturally adquiring it  vs  inoculating yourself, the safer option is the last one, inoculation by far.\\n\\n\\nRespecting your family member, ask where they got that info, non-official sites often provide misleading/fake info so beware, only try to search info with official sites, like the CDC, WHO, Pfizer, BioNTech.\\n\\n\\nIdk if I answered ur question, but hope this helps, also sorry for my english, not my native language.. Thanks so much for the info. Hi!\\n\\nI\\'d be glad to fill out your survey, but I just wanted to make sure you know that this is actually a pro-vaxx sub!. I can\\'t get past the first page because I\\'m not familiar enough with the British education system to fill out the demographics.. The only thing that I would suggest (if it‚Äôs not too late) is to add a ‚Äúretired‚Äù option to employment status. Not employed, and retired are vastly different employment statuses, but the only option a retired person currently has is ‚Äúnot employed‚Äù.. Clearly you didn\\'t read the rules. This sub is exclusively for belittling and ridiculing any idea that the TV tells you to. I\\'ve been told this countless times in this sub. This is not a sub for logical critical thinking or debate it is exclusively to bash people who want bodily autonomy.. Close! It‚Äôs for bashing people who want to bring back previously eradicated diseases!. Well, why not? They can open on their own terms, right? I\\'d be more likely to go there than a place that\\'s not taking some precautions.. The problem is now you\\'re going to have some very loud a-holes who are going to show up and start screaming about how they don\\'t have to wear a mask. So it\\'s up to the employees now to force that person to leave, or call the cops. The cops aren\\'t going to want to keep dealing with these complaints and so they\\'ll probably eventually stop coming, or they\\'ll come so late that the damage is done and all the employees are pissed or afraid because a jerk is yelling about \"my rights!\". Just announced, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/dine-in-movie-chain-alamo-drafthouse-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/dine-in-movie-chain-alamo-drafthouse-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html)\\n\\nUPDATE: One of the locations to be closed is the Alamo Drafthouse at the Ritz (downtown Austin). [https://drafthouse.com/austin/news/au-revoir-to-the-ritz](https://drafthouse.com/austin/news/au-revoir-to-the-ritz). They also just filed chapter 11 bankruptcy.... To be honest, the issue isn‚Äôt whether the state mandates masks or not. Demand is down because people perceive going to the cinema as risky. I go to see a film 3 times a week now and I‚Äôm usually the only person there. \\n\\nThe governor can cancel all the health precautions he‚Äôd like, but it still won‚Äôt make a bit of difference. If anything it will make things worse, because those that previously felt safe going to the cinema (like me), may be put off if it‚Äôs filled with nothing but a bunch of anti-masks folks trying to make a political statement than actually going to enjoy a film.. It is their right to do as they please.  This is not really news.. My wife and I LOVE Alamo Drafthouse. We have two locations here where we are, and pre-covid we would go probably once a week on a Friday or Saturday evening. Despite being a chain, it certainly doesn\\'t feel cold and corporate like some other movie theaters in our area. I LOVE their no-bullshit attitude, their awesome food and drinks (seriously, they have the best popcorn I\\'ve ever had). It\\'s just an overall charismatic and fun environment to see some great movies and she and I have some really good memories together going to both locations.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWord on the street is that one location in my hometown is not coming back and the other was apparently struggling financially even pre-covid (which I find hard to believe). She and I have been longing for the day she and I can safely go back, and the thought of them closing down for good is just absolutely heart-breaking. I hope and pray I\\'ll get to experience it again.. I\\'m keeping a list of all the businesses that are going above and beyond during the pandemic so I can make sure to give them business once I feel it\\'s safe to do so. \\n\\nAnd a list of all the places who have been dicks the whole time so I never give them my money again.. Because they are not idiots.. Mine is still closed üòï. I was happy to roll up to the grocery store and still need a mask to enter.. Good.. I have a cousin who owns a business in Texas. He\\'s been very diligent about following health guidelines to protect himself, his employees, his customers, and the community.\\n\\nLike too many other businesses, he and his employees have sometimes had to engage in uncomfortable conversations with confrontational patrons resisting wearing masks. They at least could simply point to the state mandate as justification.\\n\\nBut now, he\\'s already having customers coming in without masks, demanding service and insisting a mask isn\\'t necessary because the governor said so.\\n\\nI worry how many other well-intentioned business owners are going to face increased pushback from emboldened science deniers?. I\\'m just going to share my thoughts with everyone since the person I was responding to deleted their comment: The issue is that private business owners typically won\\'t enforce mask wearing/social distancing on their own because they are not public health experts. It\\'s the same reason why regulations/penalties need to be placed on businesses that would benefit from just dumping toxic waste into rivers. If businesses are given the option to ignore public safety measures, the burden will be on businesses who do care. This is a burden to Alamo Drafthouse. It\\'s the same reason why surprise inspections exist in the dining industry. You can\\'t trust all establishments to do the right thing. The pandemic won\\'t last forever anyway. These are temporary measures which are keeping the public\\'s health at the forefront. On the flip side, the govt has a responsibility to provide relief to businesses that are negatively impacted by the newer health safety guidelines if it can. Well guess what? Good thing we pay taxes! Relief is what people/businesses should be fighting for during a pandemic, not some kind of recklesss forced return to \"normalcy.\". Some people: \"The government should stay out of regulating small businesses, they can regulate themselves and let the free market decide.\" \\n\\nSame people: \"The government said we could open up! How dare these private establishments encroach on my freedoms by regulating themselves!\". Someone in Texas with brains!. Remember when lockdowns were supposed to be only 2 weeks?. State rules should be as least restrictive as possible to allow areas to do what‚Äôs right for them. Cities/companies should keep doing what‚Äôs right for their specific environment.. I\\'m just worried places are going to start banning mask wearing again, due to \"safety reasons\" (as in, people concealing their identity).    I\\'m used to wearing masks now and even after this is mostly behind us, I still think I want to wear one in crowded situations, like public transit -- like many people do in Asia.. Ah...now come the businesses the media will make into darlings.. I\\'m opposed to restrictions 100%, and I support this move.  It\\'s a private business, and as long as there is no discrimination they can do as they please.. I am glad abbott did no restrictions, and I am fine with businesses doing whatever they want to do. They\\'re allowed; it\\'s a private business.\\n\\nIt won\\'t last, but they\\'re allowed to.. There is going to be a huge divide in this country over masks and it won\\'t end with coronavirus. The new debate will be mask mandates during the winter to combat the flu.. At least there\\'s still people in Texas with enough sense and decency.. This is great to hear. I worked for them years ago and they really care for their employees, pay a decent wage, and provide great benefits. Hopefully they set a precedent for other businesses in Texas.. Remember the Alamo. Good luck with that. Those employees will put up with being mask police and being verbally abused for about 2 weeks before they say fuck it.. Is one establishment\\'s policy really national news?. Christ. A little hope for humanity üò≥. Lawsuits pilgrim, lawsuits. Thats the only incentive to do that kind of stuff in that part if the country. Gotta reduce liability.. I hope they will be okay. Looks like they just filed for Bankruptcy. As will 95% of other business\\'s too.. It‚Äôs hilarious to see how there is no end to the stupidity of leadership in this country. Just when you think things have hit absolute rock bottom, let‚Äôs reopen, fuck it. I‚Äôm thankful for people like Alamo.. You know the drama that‚Äôs gonna start because some Idiots will say ‚ÄúGovernor says I don‚Äôt have to‚Äù.. Why is this news?. Only one award on this post. So disappointing.. Long live the Alamo Draught House! I went to one my first time off base when I was stationed in San Antonio (2007). Being from the Midwest I‚Äôd never heard of a theatre where you could order food and beer! You could take a growler of beer home with you and that blew my mind. Good times.. Arm your employees with water guns, have a giant disclaimer that if you refuse masks we WILL squirt you! Seriously, it sounds stupid but, so are the people refusing.. That settles it - if it\\'s safe to go to the theaters by the time Spider-Man: No Way Home comes out, then I\\'ll be going to the Drafthouse in Phoenix &lt;3. At least someone in Texas has some common sense.. Why is this news? I‚Äôm sure a lot of places are going to still do that.. Take it from a sympathetic Floridian who every day marvels at the idiots in my state: Thank you for having sense compared to everyone around you and the leadership.. Good for them..Caring about Texas. Cool, they are free to do as they like.... Leaving up to them is fine. Those who agree can go and the rest of us will go somewhere else.. Thank you, Alamo drafthouse  care about texan\\'s safety , unlike our selfish greedy  gov Abbott that obviously does not give a damn if texans gets covid, or that Texans  were  freezeing &amp; cold  in our homes .\\nBc of Abbott &amp; this republican run state.\\nThey don\\'t give a damn .. HOW DARE THEY. BOYCOTT OPPRESSIVE ALAMO DRAFT HOUSE!!! /s. Ya something tells me this won‚Äôt fly in Texas.

At this point though, who is wearing a mask because a public official is making them? Those people are, aren‚Äôt wearing there masks correctly or not at all. Even if fuaci said I didn‚Äôt need a mask anymore, I‚Äôd still wear it till 2weeks after I am vaccinated.. Can cities in Texas and Mississippi not impose their own mask mandates? I\\'m sure some multi-national companies headquartered in Texas will be hesitant to completely reopen their offices and remove all safety precautions. Who is advising these governors? Who is giving them info that this is a good idea? How can they look at themselves in the mirror and be ok with what they see? How do they sleep at night? How can they look at their family members in the face and think that they are doing everything they can to protect them? Governor Abbot and governor Reeves must have no moral conscious.  \\n  \\nSo many people have died and so many more will, because they are too stupid and too proud to wear a mask. It‚Äôs a shame. Our educational system has failed us, we are producing leaders who are intellectually unfit to serve.. I live in Mississippi. Will continue to wear a mask.. Damn. Mississippi and Texas. This is good popcorn stuff right here. But what happens if their numbers don\\'t explode like the whole Florida situation? Everyone was yelling FLORIDA IS ABOUT TO KILL EVERYONE! when they just said fuck it over the summer. But then looking at the numbers its not any worst than national trends. I feel like no one ever addresses that. And if Texas and now Mississippi performs the same way, there\\'s gonna be questions that need answering.  \\n\\n\\nBut I think the worst part of it all is the CDC / Fauci current vaccine messaging. As someone who rushed to get vaccinated, I remember the promises of the vaccine being the finish line. We can start to be normal, and travel after you\\'re vaccinated. They were even talking about vaccination passports.  \\n\\n\\nBut now its like they communicating that despite the vaccine expect to continue to socially distance, keep limits on gatherings as well as keeping certain industries close. People are just fed up and saying fuck it at that point. Lets open up as vaccines are rolling out and see what happens. Theyre losing the public at this point.. Anti-mask sentiment right now is being fueled by a frustration over the results of the election.. These dumb fucks are going to make this last forever. Next time the south wants to secede, let them.. I\\'ll keep wearing mine.\\n\\nBecause I\\'m smart.. This pandemic has shown us that the majority of people only care about when they can officially stop caring.. Has nobody figured out that Republicans don‚Äôt like the fact Biden is actually making America great again so they are planning to get as manny people infected to produce another lockdown and then point the finger at democrats.. I think that a lot of the reporting on this is over exaggerating how much power and influence these governors have on their constituents day to day behaviors. Individual people and businesses will make their own choices, like they have all along. There\\'s never been any real punitive enforcement of mask mandates anywhere in America.. We have our own little version of the trump/Fauci friction going on here. Goobernor Tater says no more ‚Äúheavy hand of government‚Äù and Dr. Dobbs, the state‚Äôs senior physician, says PLEASE keep wearing masks. Tater is a baby trump because... Mississippi.. Do they wan to kill their citizens intentionally?.  Couldn\\'t this mayor enact a city ordinance?. Not to worry. \\n\\nThe citizens of Mississippi are known for their fitness and good health.. Yea  Not all ppl in Ms. have gotten  vaccine. I hope ppl value their lifes &amp; those of others and keep wearing masks . Its up to we the ppl to give a damn &amp;  look out for ourselves .. I am all for States rights but jeez.... when your State is acting stupid, Feds should over rule them. No way we should open it all up and ditch the masks yet. Let‚Äôs get this Country at least 75% or more vaccinated first. Can people walk around naked in public in Mississippi if they want to?. I\\'m fighting my customers everyday to be responsible so me or my family doesn\\'t have to die.  Lifting mask restrictions anywhere makes it so hard on the people fighting to keep their families safe too.. Still in the game with trump to see how many people they can kill off.. Yep. Once others follow suit covid will rise again!. Those who wear a mask will continue to, and those who don\\'t, will also continue to.. Meanwhile we are still in lockdown in the UK... It surely will but freedom is more important. Let‚Äôs get rid of seat belts, speed limits , and traffic lights while we at it.. covid doesn\\'t care about freedom in case you didn\\'t know that. Text:\\n\\nA crucial wing of the immune system appears to be just as good at recognising all the new coronavirus variants, a study has found.\\n\\nIn laboratory tests, T-cell responses in those vaccinated or previously infected with coronavirus were largely unaffected by each of the key variants. This included the new Brazilian variant, found in small numbers in the UK last week.\\n\\nThe new findings suggest that even if people are able to be reinfected by the variants, some of which are believed to partially evade our first immune response, the body will have key tools for preventing severe disease.\\n\\nHowever, the scientists behind the findings cautioned that the protective abilities of the  T-cell response remained to be proven in the field.\\n\\n‚ÄúIf you have a good T-cell response you may not be able to prevent infection, but you should be able to soften the blow,‚Äù said Professor Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. ‚ÄúThat is important. The opposite scenario would have been really concerning, if the new variants had been able to evade both the antibody response and the T-cell response.‚Äù\\n\\nAfter infection or vaccination, people produce antibodies specific to the coronavirus. These recognise and latch on to part of the spike the virus uses to infect cells ‚Äî effectively blocking it.\\n\\n‚ÄúBasically you create a wall and the virus bounces off that wall,‚Äù said Sette. ‚ÄúThis is sterilizing immunity.‚Äù\\n\\nOne of the concerns about new variants, particularly those from South  Africa and Brazil, is they contain a mutation that changes the shape of  the spike, meaning they evade antibodies built up against the old version.\\n\\nHowever, that is only the first line of defence. We know from vaccine trials that even if people do become infected following vaccination, they are still at least 50 per cent less likely to develop severe disease compared to those who were infected without being vaccinated.\\n\\nThe second line of defence that helps them fight off Covid comes in part from T-cells, which are harder to trick.\\n\\n‚ÄúOne of the things that T-cells do is kill infected cells or create an antiviral response,‚Äù said Sette. ‚ÄúSo, if you have T-cells you may not prevent the infection, but you may lessen the severity of the disease. You may also shorten the duration of a disease.‚Äù\\n\\nUnlike antibodies, these T-cells home in on a larger portion of the virus‚Äôs spike, meaning it has to change more significantly to elude them.\\n\\nBecause each person‚Äôs T-cells choose these larger sections of viral proteins at random, it also means it‚Äôs harder for the virus to evolve in a way that it evades them at a population level. Even if it finds a way to trick one person, that does not mean it will trick the person they infect.\\n\\nSette‚Äôs research, published ahead of peer review, used blood taken from people who had received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or been naturally infected. It showed that while their antibody response might be reduced, their T-cell response held up well.\\n\\n‚ÄúPutting two and two together you would imagine that if you have a good T-cell response you would be able to lessen symptoms.‚Äù\\n\\nThe findings will be comforting for Britain‚Äôs vaccine strategy, however public health officials cautioned it was still important to prevent the spread of new variants. No protection is perfect, and any variant that can infect people better ‚Äî even only mildly ‚Äî will risk slowing the raising of lockdown.\\n\\nSette said it will also be key to see what happens in the real world. Currently some cities in South America that are believed to have had high infection levels are seeing a second spike in hospitalisations, apparently caused by the new Brazilian variant.\\n\\nThis  includes places like Leticia in Colombia, where studies suggest that around 60 per cent of the population were previously infected with the old variant. This at least suggests that some people are being reinfected and ending up in hospital.. Makes sense since South Africa hasn‚Äôt reported an unusual number of reinfections.. Just FYI the work cited in this article from La Jolla isn\\'t published yet in a peer review journal, it is posted as a pre-print on biorxiv. As expected.\\n\\nSadly scaremongering about every new variant that comes along is a very easy way to drive clicks.. This is pretty interesting. What if a lot of people have been getting reinfected this whole time but did not show symptoms of disease?\\n\\nI can\\'t imagine somebody that had COVID confirmed would suddenly decide to go get randomly tested at some point months later. It would be pretty easy to just not show up in data. \\n\\nThis would also be really good news for the long term \"immunity\" - that is, of severe disease, of both vaccinated AND infected people.. If your T-cells aren\\'t recognizing any foreign substances whatsoever you have an immune deficiency. T-virus confirmed. We‚Äôre all doomed. DOOMED!! üòÜ. Variants aren‚Äôt gonna do jack shit, to the dismay of the media, and also people who secretly want this pandemic to last forever.. I have a general question on this topic I‚Äôm hoping somebody could shed some light on. Since T cells in someone who was infected and recovered would have ‚Äúseen‚Äù the whole virus, including the spike protein, and T cells of people vaccinated (at least with Pfizer, moderna, or j&amp;j) have only ‚Äúseen‚Äù the spike protein, wouldn‚Äôt it stand to reason that the response would be better in the recovered person rather than the vaccinated? did they do such a good job modifying the spike protein that the vaccines generate that it somehow makes the response as strong or stronger even though it‚Äôs less for the t-cells to recognize? Thanks!. So the same thing the \"conspiracy\" folk were saying 8 months ago, based on the well documented science of the same immune response in those with Sars (original) showing immunity a decade later.  Glad to see the mainstream media finally caught up.. Good this is confirmed, but this shouldn‚Äôt really have been a major concern. Times we live in, media driven fear, and public health officials not quite understanding how their words of caution get reinterpreted as words of doom led to the idea this was ever a serious concern.. Crucially, this study was done with blood from vaccinated individuals, not necessarily real COVID survivors. It doesn\\'t say much about natural infection/reinfection but it does confirm the potential of vaccines.\\n\\nMy guess - and it\\'s only a guess - is that once a majority of people are vaccinated, any circulating variants will work as \"natural booster shots,\" strengthening the immunity of vaccinated people with mild or no symptoms.. #NOOOO! BUT MUH WORRYING SIGNS!!!. lockdown harder!!!111!!one!. T-cells? Wasnt the virus is resident evil called the T-virus. I dont like the way this is going. Go outside..

Yeah it\\'s criticized because the Indian government has approved and administered the vaccine to many people before completing it\\'s phase 3. Just like the Russian and Chinese vaccines. It wasn\\'t criticized because it was an Indian vaccine.. &gt; The vaccine maker didn‚Äôt say if the efficacy rate was measured at protecting against all symptoms, including mild coughs, or just serious reactions to the disease that require hospitalization.\\n\\nIt would be nice to know what their metrics are.  I hope it works very well and that India is doing well in it\\'s vaccination efforts -- not just for India but also for Brazil and other countries that India supplies.. The Phase 3 study of Covaxin involved 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age. Of these, 2,433 were over the age of 60 and 4,500 had comorbidities.\\n\\nThe first interim analysis of Covaxin is based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus seven cases observed in the BBV152 (Covaxin) group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6 per cent.\\n\\nAs per Bharat Biotech, the interim analysis included a preliminary review of the safety database. This showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups.. The more vaccines the better!. BIG! Amazing effort from the Indian scientists. Already waiting for the \\'How to make covid vaccine at home episode 1\\' youtube videos. Good job India.. India truly impressing me throughout this pandemic so far, they‚Äôve got a few issues but the country is rapidly proving itself to be world-class.. It will be interesting to see if we ever get data on the differences in immune response to variants from people vaccinated with a whole, inactivated virus as the antigen compared to the vaccines which target only the spike protein. My understanding is that most of the variant mutations are focused around the spike protein so perhaps an inactivated virus might lose less effectiveness on those mutations?. Noteworthy that the cited study has an n=43, meaning that individual persons can swing results by multiple percentage-points. Not high enough for me. There‚Äôs more effective vaccines out there.. I hope with this the government approves general use.\\n\\nCurrently, one is required to sign a consent form to get this vaccine.. well it\\'s ONLY n=43 patients COVID cases where they based efficacy numbers on, so the 95% credible range must be super wide. If one extra person in the COVID Vaxxed group increase, then the efficacy can change by 2%.. Better than the shit Johnson and Johnson developed.. You mean for you specifically or for everyone who would have it available to them to take? Both interpretations don‚Äôt make sense. The first one because who cares. The second because we need as many vaccines as possible and Pfizer/Moderna don‚Äôt have the supply or capacity to provide vaccines to everyone in the world.\\n\\nI really don‚Äôt understand the point of your comment..

Coming down from the First World War and a deadly flu pandemic‚Ä¶ people must have been ready to do something that didn‚Äôt involve life and death for a change.. Hopefully in the next two months, we\\'ll see the tiers of vaccination opening up fast.   It seems we\\'ve been stuck at 65+ for ages.. We are almost there. This summer is going to be spectacular.. NUT\\n\\n*Link to the address: https://youtu.be/q4iz_fH1mgU\\n\\nHe also said all teachers will be directed to be vaccinated by the end of March through the pharmacy vaccines.. I wonder if that means by end of May that the supply is ready but in a warehouse somewhere or if I can actually get jabbed same-day.. Twice postponed wedding is schedule for June. LET‚ÄôS GO!. I\\'m so excited to actually be able to do college student things as a college student. Let\\'s gooooo! I can\\'t wait to never check this subreddit again. I remember being here when there were 25k subscribers. # WE LIKE THE VACCINE. This is it folks. We\\'re in the endgame now. Taking my stimmy and my vaccy to go, thanks joe. BEYOND happy about this but genuine question, will we see a significant uptick in 24/7 vaccination sites to match the incoming supplies?. Underpromise, overperform. A nice change from a series of lies, excuses, and shrugs.. I know this article has been out for less than an hour but I feel like this is absolutely huge news (in a good way). The beach better be ready for my Baywatch run because I\\'m gonna be hitting it hard.. This feels like the first time since the pandemic started that we actually improved on an original estimate. Great sign and helps improve the optimism that the end is in sight.. Let‚Äôs go!. The USA is going to have the biggest Independence day party in the history of the country. I CANNOT WAIT!. That‚Äôs less than 3 months away. Get that champagne on ice! LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GO!. I\\'m so happy for you USA that you will get to enjoy your summer and not have to wait until the fall, like us up north...... States are already jumping the gun too and just saying \"fuck it, everything back open next week\". Congrats US. You guys are pretty good. Sometimes, this gets forgotten in all the noise.\\n\\nThis is a really well executed vaccine rollout. Given the population size, it is hands down the best performance by any country in the vaccination effort.. Canadian jealousy intensifies.\\n\\nBut this is likely good news for us Canadians as well, less risk of cross boarder spread and hopefully some of their production lines can help supply us with vaccines in June and beyond.. There is absolutely NO reason why we can‚Äôt be pretty much back to normal by fall. None.. I love this. The White House hopefully just gave Governors a target for easing all restrictions: June 1st.. Second roaring twenty‚Äôs coming in. Bars  clubs and restaurants are going to see volume like never before come the end of this. This summer is going to be a giant party fest of fucking sneezing next to someone and being like bless you dog and moving along not alright let‚Äôs go this mfer is about to turn. This would be amazing!!! We can guarantee not only a fully open, but fully safe summer. Orgies are back on the menu folks.\\n\\n\\n**Someone invite me too one I\\'m amazing at them**\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease. Mental health wellbeing wise all I really need is for most people to be vaccinated by like the 4th of July. Two months of normal summer outside of like maybe airports or whatever.\\n\\nEven June, man. I\\'ll mask up in June if need-be. But let\\'s have a good July.. Hnnghhh.. Let the Roaring 20s Part II begin!. My thrice postponed Vegas trip with all my friends is now scheduled for July. WOOOO. Hellllllll yesssss! Summer 2021 gonna be lit!!!. I‚Äôve been dying to go on a trip to somewhere, anywhere, but won‚Äôt get on a plane until I‚Äôm vaccinated. With this news, I‚Äôm pretty much decided I‚Äôll be going to Mexico City sometime in June as they don‚Äôt have any entry restrictions. \\n\\nHell, I‚Äôd book my flight right now, except we have our boring as shit 3 day long Q3 planning meetings in June at work, so I‚Äôm waiting until they announce the dates so I can book my trip that week and miss it.. Inject this directly into my ~~veins~~ arm.. While Justin Trudeau tries to tell us he has a plan, all while having no plan for the vaccines scheduled to arrive tomorrow.. cries in canadian. Novavax is expected to be approved in the UK in April and the US in May.\\n\\nThe news is getting better and better by the day.. Yes. Inject this directly into my... arm.. Yassss, get the US done so the rest of us can get access to US vaccine manufacturers! Great news! This is a global battle, so every vaccination gets us closer to a longterm victory. SO HYPED. This is the most hopeful about this thing ending before summer. We‚Äôre doing it Joe!!!. And to think \"every adult\" includes at least a portion of people who are vaccine-hesitant or not interested at all. I could cry.. It‚Äôs amazing that the US will be done, having given all adults full doses of the vaccines, whereas the U.K. will have still only given folks one half doses.. And us here in Canada will all be dead.. &gt; The University of Michigan is banning 375 students who haven\\'t taken required COVID-19 tests from entering non-residential buildings on campus, the school announced Wednesday morning. \\n\\n&gt; The undergraduate students had their Mcards, which they scan to enter buildings, deactivated and received emails Tuesday telling them of the move, after what the university said was multiple attempts to reach them.\\n\\n&gt; This means the students can\\'t go into buildings housing classes, laboratories or even social activities. The vast majority of all classes being offered this semester are virtual. It\\'s not known exactly how many students are actually on campus or using buildings.. I feel really bad for college students right now. They are missing out on what should be some of the best years of their life, and not getting a proper education despite paying huge amounts of money. In some colleges they are treated like prisoners.. It‚Äôs going to be funny watching what UofM does when most of their conference is back at full capacity stadiums in the fall.  Do they virtue signal like UofM is prone to do or go for the money?   I mean they were the leaders of the pack to cancel college football last season by forming a Midwest coalition. And then Notre Dame told them to go to hell and recked that plan.  Amazing how college football was totally unsafe one week then totally fine the next.. Good to see somewhere still enforcing rules.. Good for them.\\n\\nEdit to clarify, them = U of M. Don\\'t comply with the rules, then they don\\'t get to go in. Rules without teeth are useless.. Good. Fuck\\'em.. They better not lock Billy Magic out! (Is he human? Can he get covid at all?). U of M student here, living off-campus. I applied for a virtual job and had to show up to the Student Activities Building to turn in documents, and they wouldn‚Äôt accept my documents because I hadn‚Äôt been tested that week. \\n\\nJokes on them, I got Covid at the end of January so now I‚Äôm good to go without testing until I go home in mid-April.. As a college student, I can understand their frustration and anger, especially now that college students and faculty are on the last step of most state vaccination boards. I know of a few people who live on campus now and they are simply just restricted to living in their rooms. \\n\\nI really don‚Äôt get why college students aren‚Äôt prioritized especially consider college students travel quite a lot. I go to Syracuse and my girlfriend goes to Penn State and its been really hard to watch her be out 4-5 nights a week whereas not a ton is open for us up here. Done a number on my mental health, that\\'s for sure. I\\'m so ready for normal. Because they are at extremely low risk of death and serious disease (hospitalization).. I\\'m also a college student.\\n\\nFuck these assholes who think the rules shouldn\\'t apply to them and put others in danger. If they can\\'t follow the rules then they shouldn\\'t be attending. \\n\\nNobody should be getting on a plane or traveling in a pandemic. It\\'s called *lockdown* for a reason.. The godawful messaging about the vaccine hasn\\'t helped either.. Well if we want to be honest about it. Anyone that takes information off of the internet without validating it with other sources.... No shit. \\'May\\'.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFuck that weasel-y, spineless bullshit speech.  That\\'s a \\'WILL\\' kind of scenario.. The pandemic has taught me I can live very happily within my circle of trusted people.  I will just be asking people straight up if they got vaccinated and if they say no or don‚Äôt want to share that information well then they can go.. Anti-vaxxers will always be there, but I don\\'t know that labeling all concerns as crazy helps either. There are genuine concerns; they should be openly addressed and discussed, supported by scientific evidence. If not, people go looking at ADE and auto-immune complications without any context.. I\\'d imagine lifting mandates to soon as well.  Opening up sure but keeping mask to at least see how long the vaccines last.. Hopefully a hella long time but doesn\\'t seem like we know this just yet.  Not like it\\'s been out a few years. Someone should send this article to the governor of Texas.. The solution is to jail antivaxxers during the pandemic. They\\'re attention seekers who need alone time.. Why am I not surprised?. No way?. Anti-maskers last year, anti-vaxxers now.. Does water make grass grow?. Once you hit a \\'certain\\' age, most know someone that has been negatively impacted by a vaccine or a medicine.  For me it was Cipro, after 6 months I returned to normal but my friends Achilles tendon snapped off and now he limps forever even after surgery.\\n\\nMy sisters friend died of Guillain-Barre syndrome, never having had an issue with the flu shot prior.  That years flu shot was completely ineffective as well but her employer was pumping them out like free chocolates so everyone took them.\\n\\nA healthy dose of skepticism is never a bad thing.  Blind faith is.   \\n\\nI was misdiagnosed for 8 years as having about 30 different things, given medicines etc which turned out to be thyroid related.   \\n\\nPeople like me are the ones that are watching and listening to those that have had the vaccine to see how they take to it.  I\\'m on the fence right now whereas two months prior I was a no way no how.   I see how doctors are forced to cattle people in and out.  Ive had antibiotics prescribed to me that my pharmacist caught as something Im allergic to, one of which (Cipro) really did a number on me.   \\n\\nSo while Im not hopeful herd immunity will preclude me from getting vaccinated, I am hopeful that through due diligence of the various vaccines available I will pick the right one for me and eventually get it.. however the Anti-vaxxers may not prolong should they get the virus. Prolong it for them. Thinning of the herd. CDC/WHO misinformation (read: deliberate lies) about masks in March 2020 certainly prolonged the pandemic.. People being vaccinated thinking they\\'re safe from covid, going out with no masks will prolong the pandemic. Both side supporting here!. Cant blame people. The government lied to them. They dont trust the government, they have to look for information elsewhere\\n\\nTake the French government for example. Last March they didn\\'t have enough masks so what did they do? They told French people that masks are useless. Should French people trust their government now when they say the vaccines are safe?. Article dated March 2nd, 2021. Thank you, Israel National News, for telling us something that was obvious last year.\\n\\nEdit: Not me, us.. there was a phase of denial in the government early of March last year (which made loose sleep and I did not bring my kid to school that week).

We still have people and businesses that haven‚Äôt recovered because the states power grid couldn‚Äôt handle it getting cold. People died because the states power grid couldn‚Äôt operate in the cold. And, this is the shit they‚Äôre concerned with? Not helping people recover from the states failure? \\n\\n**Fuck Abbot.**. To our friends in Texas. Keep doing what you know is right. Abbott may be a fool but that\\'s no excuse for you to be. Hold the line a little longer, we\\'re getting so close!. Which state is doing worse than texas?. I\\'m honestly burnt-out on even having an opinion on things like this anymore. In the beginning I was glad that my state was more proactive and aggressive in setting public health restrictions, but now it seems like it\\'s hardly made a difference. After the northeast was hit hard early on I thought the tide would turn and the states resisting any mandates would bear the brunt of the pandemic. Now a year later and the northeast is still among the worst death toll in the nation.\\n\\nThere seems to be very little correlation between any state-wide factors and the spread of COVID.. I hate it here. Texas and Florida continue to lead the Bible Belt into shame. Texas in February: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just cold, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen‚Äù\\n\\nTexas in March: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a cold, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen‚Äù. Feel bad for Texans. A government that ignored expert advice to weather-proof their energy infrastructure causing people to die, and just a few weeks later they are doing the same thing regarding COVID measures despite dealing with a horrific performance by nearly all measures.. Abbott now, ‚ÄúWhat power outage?‚Äù. They have less vaccinations since they essentially missed a week of vaccinations in February due to the storms. Hopefully they can catch back up soon.. This is what you get when the rich have all the power. A preview of America under permanent minority rule.. I feel sorry for the people they have to suffer, because of the decisions from their gouverneur.. Public officials there aren‚Äôt using public health to guide public policy. shitty data... \\n\\nthey dipped in administration due to weather, however currently on pace to catch up within about a week. You can look at daily trends.. And that\\'s why lifting the mandate was a god-damned stupid idea.. Welcome to Texas where the rules are made up and the deaths don‚Äôt matter.. I wanted to laugh, but even though Virginia‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call us we‚Äôll call you‚Äù system is easy we have only administered like 30% of our vaccines and are ranked 41th in rollout. Meep.\\n\\nEdit: Nevermind. It was an old article okay. My bad, I‚Äôm a moron, yadda yadda yadda. Abbott bout dumb af ü§¶üèΩ\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è. Abbott one dumb mf....smfh.

I want to go back to the bar. ~~Whooping~~ whopping. &gt; Infections in nursing homes have plummeted in a month.  The positives have decreased by 95% between January 24 and February 21, according to data published by the Government this Tuesday and confirming that the effect of vaccination is noticeable in these centers. **From January 18 to 24, 4,439 positives were registered, compared to 215 from February 15 to 21**.  At the height of the third wave in Spain, the second doses began to be administered in residences, 21 days after the vaccination campaign began, at the end of December.  Seven days later the effect of the immunization begins to be noticed.  The fall in infections, in which vaccination converges and that this third wave is subsiding, gives hope to these centers, hard hit during the pandemic.  In this period, the number of deaths also decreased: from 673 to 157.\\n\\n&gt; Other news for hope is that there are several communities that have not had a single contagion in nursing homes in the last recorded week, that of February 15.  In five communities (Asturias, Cantabria, Murcia, Navarra and La Rioja) and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, infections have fallen to zero that week after vaccination.  In another five (Andalusia, the Balearic Islands, Extremadura, Madrid and the Basque Country) there were less than 10 cases, always according to the report.  There are also several communities that do not register any deaths that week of February 15.. Whooping 95%?\\n\\n*Violent J smiles*. Maybe they meant like the cough?. Yeah, I saw that in the title &amp; was like, great, whooping cough, all we need now..

This is enough to vaccinate 1% or 2% of the population depending on their dosage application.. Oh god, I originally read that headline as \"Kanye.\" \\n\\nI was like \"Leave it to that narcissistic mofo to want a million doses for *himself. Gotta vax all those egos.\". Since no one actually read the article and are asking questions easily answered by the article:\\n\\n&gt; Kenya has received just over 1 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the **first batch** from the global COVAX initiative that was created to ensure that low- and middle-income countries have fair access to vaccines.\\n\\nand\\n\\n&gt; The minister said the vaccines will be administered to some 400,000 medical workers and the rest will go to other frontline workers such as teachers and police officers.. Good, now if we can feed all those starving children who went without food due to global lockdowns.. In which countries were those vaccines produced?. The irony of that is he‚Äôs an antivaxxer.. At this point and time it\\'s probably best to not allow anyone in or out of Brasil. Yes I know it has spread but we can do better and contain it there and slow it\\'s version spreading even more world wide. I still think if the WHO and the rest of the world shut down travel out of Wuhan at the beginning this could have been localized or a lot less severe than it was.. This variant should be called Bolsonaro-1\\n\\nThe virus was born after any lockdown measures were completely lifted in Manaus, when most believed that the region had reached \\'herd immunity\\' (&gt;70%)\\n\\nPeople just stop using masks and keeping social distance following Bolsonaro\\'s insistence that no one needs it, claiming that the pandemic is mostly a media conspiracy to bring his government down.. So a couple of interesting things about this. First, Brazil\\'s peak respiratory virus season is April so they are heading into what would be December if we equate it to the US respiratory season. Not that it means much but if the seasonality of the virus in the US played a part in the drive up of cases in the US (and I think the evidence supports that it did), Brazil would be in a similar state only they are just starting it. \\n\\nSecond, there is an interesting opinion that I link below that the lockdowns are the ones driving the more lethal and contagious variants. It is hard to explain but it is an interesting position to present and I don\\'t support or condemn it but it could be another unintended consequence of lockdowns such that they cause the more contagious virulent strains to appear than without lockdowns.\\n\\nhttps://thecritic.co.uk/mutant-variations-and-the-danger-of-lockdowns/. More great news. It\\'s probably already in America. The media isn\\'t reporting it because they want to have a false sense of security, which is what the public wants to hear right now. Denying reality and the truth will only lead to more trouble. Everyone needs to accept reality that covid isn\\'t going to disappear anytime soon.. I read t cell immunity means we don\\'t have to worry. Should be worried about this in the US? Seems like bad news to take seriously that could hamper progress.. I‚Äôm waiting for someone to type with the funky capitals mocking any sort of concern made towards variants over the past few months, because nothing defeats COVID like mocking your fellow concerned public citizens. \\n\\nThis will last for years.. Fear! Be scared! Everyone is going to die!. The Brazil strain is near antibody escape.\\nYou believe it will become more similar to the Wuhan strain again?\\n\\nLuckily, Brazilian tourists take Insta selfies everywhere by now (except Asia &amp; Oz). So the blame can be shared.. this is an entire article based on the opinion of one guy, a brazilian neuroscientist who doesn‚Äôt even live in brazil.\\n\\nmeantime, preprints are showing that p.1 defeats some antibody cocktails currently in use. however, it‚Äôs actually weaker against antibodies (and therefore the vaccine) than the south african variant everyone was hyping up. i don‚Äôt think you need to worry that much about it.. wE WiLl Be nOrMaL bY tHiS sUmMeRtImE!!!. LA County where I\\'m from will likely move to next Tier next week.  \\n\\nI still ain\\'t going out without a mask or anywhere with too many people until I\\'m vaccinated lol. CA was the first state to lockdown and will be the very last state to reopen.. I hope people still takes it seriously so we don‚Äôt go back to November. How is this good news? We haven\\'t reached herd immunity via the vaccines yet, so we just risk spreading all of the different variants that exist.. You\\'re really going to wear a mask forever? But why? \\n\\nYou lived life JUST FINE before you knew COVID was a thing. \\n\\nI get learning lessons, but at a point you\\'re going to have to move on with life.

We don\\'t have a choice yet, as anyone not in priority group 1 doesn\\'t get an appointment right now. I\\'d take an AZ shot tomorrow, if I had the chance and I\\'d guess millions of other germans would do the same. But our government needs to open AZ for more willing priority groups, before that could happen.. All these articles make it seem like Germans are booking vaccine appointments, turning up, and then leaving when they find out it\\'s the AstraZeneca shot. When in reality, the population of people eligible to get the AZ shot is so small they can\\'t fill all the available appointments. I bet if you polled anyone outside the UK they would prefer the Pfizer or Moderna shots over AZ, but that does not mean that those people would turn down the AZ shot if offered. \\n\\nGermany simply needs to expand the eligible population for the AZ shot, either by raising the age limit or opening up vaccinations to under-65 year olds.. &gt; 35-year-old surgeon Johannes told us he had been eager to get his first shot, so he could stop worrying so much about the risks of potentially carrying the disease from the hospital back home to his partner and their newborn son.\\n\\nThis is how the news work. Ask a person and make an article about his worries. Meanwhile if you ask the people giving out the vaccines they say they can‚Äôt keep up with demand and had to delay due to issues with staffing and booking system and there is plenty of demand.\\n\\nBut let‚Äôs not go trough all the effort and rather ask 35 year old Johannes in Hamburg\\n\\nEdit: If anyone wants to give google translate a try. Here is a German article from actual news German consume debunking what the article above claims:\\n\\nhttps://www.tagesschau.de/inland/astrazeneca-impfstrategie-laender-101.html. TL;DR: Germans don‚Äôt want to take the AstraZeneca because:\\n- has more side effects than the Pfizer one\\n- apparently only 60-90% effectiveness compared to 95% of the Pfizer one\\n- not government approved for people over 65\\n- the same reasons Germans want to drive a Porsche instead of a \"cheap Asian car\" (\"why take the cheap one when you could have the good, expensive one\")\\n\\nResult: lots of vaccines that don‚Äôt get used. Only 6% vaccinated even though there would me more vaccine available. That\\'s just the tip of the iceberg for all the problems.. Oxford vaccine was gonna be open source. But then capitalism kicked in. AstraZeneca doesn\\'t really have a good image right now. 62% efficacy at preventing disease, useless against the South Africa variant, cancelled shipments in some countries because it is not effective against their variants. It\\'s just a bad image. It has way higher than 62%, way way higher. Look at the UK.\\n\\nIt is weak against the SA variant but still decently effective and with a booster, should eradicate it as well.. üßê Silly Billy hawkseye.

Stop giving me awards lol. If I said to myself few months ago I would be coming to this sub to get good news, I\\'d call myself crazy. This is great and works as expected though.. I don\\'t mind wearing a mask and do whenever required but I cannot wait for the day to come that I no longer need to. I\\'m hoping by the end of summer the mask mandate is lifted at least in Maine. \\n\\nMy job follows federal guidelines though so who knows how long I will have to stay masked at work.. More and more everyday it feels like we‚Äôll be back to normal sometime this summer.. Are you telling me that science works? Not conspiracies and misinformation?. Hoping vaccinated folks get more guidance soon, other than, \"vaccinated people can still spread this!\". That would be pretty cool. When I bookmarked [worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), there were 82,723 cases and 2,817 deaths. I try to not check it daily. I can\\'t wait till I can delete that bookmark and never think about it again.. Can we save the coronavirus sub to the internet archive somehow? Idk how that works but they should be hard archived for posterity.. Fuck i cannot wait until life can resume. I miss house parties. I miss playing shows. I miss going to shows. I miss being drunk at a strangers house meeting all sorts of new people. I\\'ve started going mad being trapped inside all day.. This is dedicated to all of those people who keep on believing that the vaccine doesn\\'t stop the spread of the virus. \\nEvidence is slowly being released. \\nSoon this sub will indeed be dead. Just got my second moderna shot yesterday. Feel like shit today but glad to be fully vaccinated finally!. God, I fucking hope. \\n\\nI just want to fucking hug my grandfather.. I\\'ve been trying to get an appointment for weeks. This morning I got 3 all at once. Whoops, gotta cancel 2, but I\\'m happy that I\\'m finally gonna get vaccinated.. &gt;\"may\"  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;‚ÄúWhat we don‚Äôt yet know is how long that might last and whether or not that will be enough to stop the infection spreading more widely in the population over time,‚Äù  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;\"If the hopes are fulfilled \"\\n\\nI hope so too (and expect it to), but there\\'s not a lot of new info here. A person says that they hope it will do this.  That\\'s about it for what\\'s in the article.. Isn\\'t that the point of a vaccine?. So why are we being told this spring is going to be so bad? Feels like this might be dead by the end of spring.. *BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines\\n\\nIMO headlines referring to \\'vaccines\\' should specify which vaccines, headlines referring to \\'variant\\' should specify which variant, etc. Don\\'t worry. Texas has decided to personally ensure the virus continues. They\\'re removing their mask mandate and opening up 100% capacity.. Really hoping they‚Äôre effective with new strains. Yeah. If people can ever actually get them.. I sure hope they do.. Apart from the media spreading daily doom and gloom, was there any reason to believe that they wouldn‚Äôt?. Keep going everyone, we\\'re almost there!. No shit? Isnt that the point of the vaccine? Am I missing something?. Definitely stops you from getting sick.

CDC has already said this basically, \"no maximum interval\".\\n\\nPfizer has said not to exceed 6 weeks, but that\\'s probably just because that\\'s what they included in the P3 trial.. &gt;The Globe and Mail is not identifying the sources, who are familiar with the NACI deliberations, because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\\n\\nSo you are running with a story leaked by people not authorized to speak to the public. Yeah, that seems like a source to be believed versus.. From the article:\\n\"she made the decision after discussions with NACI as well as a review of ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù data.\"\\n\\nI could be very wrong, but I don\\'t think there\\'s any real-world clinical data hat shows how long the antibodies from just 1 shot can last. Israel has reduced their pandemic by a lot, but a) they\\'ve been vaccinating less than 4 months, and b) they actually give 2 shots, 3 weeks apart - so they also can\\'t provide any data for the \"4 months apart\" camp.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear if going with just 1 shot for so long would keep all the new variants at bay. From what I can tell, their decision was based on severely strained logistics, as well as the assumption (not the hard data) that the impact of 1 shot will last for a while.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen only 1 peer-reviewed paper arguing for a longer gap. It used the word \"likely\" - and argued for a 5-week gap, not a 4-month gap.\\n\\nThis is a hot mess.... This worries me as studies on AZ vaccine shows at 100 protection collapses without a second shot.. Longer is generally better as the immune systems‚Äô response means less useful T cells die out over time. \\nThat‚Äôs why generally a one year gap is left between vaccination and boosters. Earlier vaccination boosts the less useful components as well as the desirable ones..

Getting the Pfizer vaccine (first dose) today.  I‚Äôm so pumped!. I keep seeing all these headlines about Pfizer, AZ, and J&amp;J regarding how effective they are, how well they work against the variants, how long they last, and how well they stop transmission.....but never anything about Moderna.  Is there a reason that vaccine seems to have fewer follow up studies, or is it just that they don\\'t garner as many headlines?. I think we are now in a position to say that the Pfizer trials were over controlled and the results are overly optimistic.  This is what happens when run by for profit companies.\\n\\nWhereas the shit show trials from Oxford showed a lack of control and the results produced went the other way.  More open, more confusion, shitty resulted. \\n\\nIMHO Real world is going to show them similar,  I am not convinced the wild spike produces less effect by 20%.  We shall see in time.. People are misreading...this is 4 weeks after ONE Dose, the 2nd boosts you up to the 95 % ffs.. The study was by Public Health England (which you would know if you had even read the top of the first page), essentially the stats wing of the NHS, it\\'s only investors are the public as it is publicly funded via taxation through the NHS.\\n\\n\\nBut judging from the rest of your message I\\'m going to go ahead and guess that reality and facts don\\'t matter that much to you.. The vaccine was invented by biontech so you are safe.. Just take the J&amp;J vaccine then.. Excerpt of note:\\n\\n‚ÄúThere has been an 82 percent decline in new COVID-19 cases among residents at nursing homes since the peak during the week of Dec. 20‚Äù.

Let\\'s face it, teacher are enjoying everything about online learning. No commute, no disruptive kids. And classes that last for only something like 2 hours a day.\\n\\nThey\\'ll try to keep schools closed until kids get vaccinated. And then, at that point, they\\'ll probably push for virtual school to be the permanent state of things.. Biden told the states to prioritize teachers by the end of the month and get them back in the classrooms.  This is the easiest and fastest way to get that done.  If the teachers want to wait until they‚Äôre eligible in another phase and try to get one of the other vaccines, that‚Äôs their prerogative but once they‚Äôre offered a vaccine they really don‚Äôt have any reason to refuse to go back to work.  The J&amp;J vaccine is still 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death, it‚Äôs a very good option.. In trials J&amp;J was shown to be 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death. A teacher getting some cold-like symptoms for a week is not really a problem. We just need to get these vaccines into people\\'s arms.. The real world efficacy for AZ and Pfizer / Moderna are extremely similar. \\n\\nI would expect the same from JnJ. Take what you can get and move along.. well the vaccines that we have in the USA are all good, and pretty much stop you from dying if you get covid. Beggers cant be choosers. Many teachers ARE 20-30 year olds and they are certainly at lower risk than old people who are currently prioritized above them. If they are old themselves then they\\'re already at highest priority right now.. Welcome to r/science! This is a heavily moderated subreddit in order to keep the discussion on science.

Is there sufficient Vitamin D deficiency for this to be credible?. I take 10k ui a day and on my physical my doctor always tells me I\\'m low. EVERY FREAKING YEAR. Wait, there were two previous studies posted that found no link to COVID severity. What do?. Why are some southern states being hit harder than northern states? Are people not getting out in the sun enough?. As with pretty much every other COVID thesis, I\\'ve seen a lot of ostensibly credible research saying that VitD is a huge causal factor...and a lot of ostensibly credible research saying that VitD is NOT a causal factor.\\n\\nThe medical research industry as a whole has not done itself many favors this past year. I understand that no one is centrally organizing the research or its communication--and indeed, that\\'s part of how scientific inquiry is supposed to work--but the absolutely nonstop barrage of contradictory information about this virus is frustrating.\\n\\nAnd of course the larger problem is that it casts doubt on all the other, non-COVID research out there, with only perhaps a few scattered teams looking into. If we can\\'t trust (or even find) the COVID narrative, what hope is there for all the stuff that the entire world *isn\\'t* furiously pouring attention and resources into?\\n\\nSeriously, after more than a year of literally the entire world trying to figure this thing out, we don\\'t seem to definitively know much more than when we started. What\\'s going on? Is this one especially hard to unravel? Or is all our medical research infrastructure just less competent than anyone wants to admit? \\n\\nVitamin D supplements are just about the least dangerous possible intervention, cheap and universally available, and the deficiency thesis has been around since last spring. How have we not (collectively) definitively answered this question *months* ago?. This may explain why some POC communities on the Western Hemisphere are being hit harder. It‚Äôs more difficult to get vitamine D from sunlight with more melamine in the skin.. I remember when this was considered an unfounded anti mask type statement. \\n\\nSeems like truth is truth. No matter if you don‚Äôt like who says it.. Sadly this isn‚Äôt new news.. This feels like one of those correlation not causation type situations.. So what\\'s a good healthy dose of D3 to take that wouldn\\'t be considered overdoing it? 1000ug?. Just need to inject some sunlight. I see studies that declare that there‚Äôs no indication that D supplementation makes a person less resistant to covid. They don‚Äôt mention that many people are vitamin D deficient to begin with. It‚Äôs kinda misleading.. Too much vitamin D will send you blind and can be fatal. Be careful.. \"Being a human accounts for 100% of covid-19 deaths\". remember, u dont get any vitamin D sitting behind glass or in ur car, the sunlight has to touch your skin directly , glass blocks the needed spectrum completely, not sure how sunscreen affects it though. Not true at all. Tons of minks were culled because infections threatened a whole industry.. We all need some of this good news.. Hell yea, lfg. Fuck yeah we rule\\n\\n*sitting at home in week 3 of quarantine*. Definitely good news.  But not unexpected due to freezing cold weather.  I want to see what happens in the next 6 - 8 weeks as people venture out, particularly older vulnerable people.. In my county more than 10% of the population has tested positive for Covid to date. It feels like those who are going to get it via bad behavior or bad luck, got it. Hopefully the vaccine can protect the rest of us. I get my 2nd shot next week.... Wow, just as my boss gets it and my wifes co worker.. weird.. It\\'s pretty early for vaccinations to have much impact on this, so it is kind of curious.. Just gotta hold on to these numbers till we can get 85% vaccinated. I worry that the antivaxxer/covid deniers are going to ruin it though.. Way to go folks. Finally and it\\'s helping reduce flu also.. Time to go 100% like Texas. My local schools and hospital are so bummed out by that number that they decided to stop doing temperature checks at the doors.  Lets see if we can get that number up back where it belongs. /s. Worst possible take on the matter.. Tons of appointments still open for tomorrow even and the website says it is open to any Illinois resident. Might be a sign that Phase 1C is coming pretty soon? If Carbondale wasn\\'t such a far drive I know a lot of people that would sign up.. UGH! 10 hours is a bit to drive in one day.... For sure checking it out.. Hope 1C comes soon, need to keep the pace up (and I might personally qualify under 1C so that\\'d be a nice perk).. \\n\\nWelcome to /r/pregnant! This is a space for everyone.

I get Moderna #2 in just a little under 3 weeks.. I had my second moderna yesterday. Had a slightly elevated temperature this morning and I\\'m tired. The tiredness is also possibly from my baby breakdancing all night so I can\\'t sleep.. I got mine today too!. That was fast. Great news. There are openings at mass vaccination site this week in Speedway. Mass vaccination sites will only administer J&amp;J vaccine.. Box just introduced the possibility of booster shots this fall for those most at risk, depending on how the data look.\\n\\nI have my 1st appt this Monday, but I\\'ll take the J&amp;J in September if it\\'s proven to help.. I think Lindsay (don‚Äôt remember last name) in governor‚Äôs press conference said they don‚Äôt expect more J&amp;J soon so the mass sites will eventually be giving Pfizer and Moderna. Was watching while working.. That was pretty quick. I wonder how soon it will take to get to 45 with the J&amp;J vaccine having been approved.. Also, any enrolled veteran 18+ can get the vaccine at the VA starting March 1.. My parents scheduled theirs this morning, I am ECSTATIC!. Whoa, that happened fast.  I\\'m probably next.  Holy shit, that was way faster than I thought.  Way to go Indiana and USA in general.  Awesome news.. No waiting to register online this morning. And multiple sites in our rural county with openings. Took about 5 minutes and appointment is in 5 days.. WOOT! So excited not to have to worry so much about family members!. Any info on those with preexisting conditions who are younger than 55?. When do grocery store workers get access? At what point will the threshold be low enough for the age limits to not apply? 40?. My parents got a text from Meijer yesterday saying that they can schedule their first vaccination for today.. I\\'m 42 cant wait!!. I kind of thought that people with immune deficiency would have happened sooner than otherwise healthy folks over 55.\\n\\nAt the end of the day we still have a vaccine at a very amazing pace and Indiana is doing this in an orderly way. Like many people, I am worried. I am pretty much housebound but my kids are going to school, and bring that home daily. It‚Äôs just hard to stay patient.. I keep seeing things on the coronavirus subreddit about getting on a wait list and they call you at the end of the day and you have to come within 30 min. Is this actually happening in Indiana? If yes, where? I just don\\'t want the mask mandate to go away prior to getting vaccinated.. They have been handling this very poorly. There\\'s been so many teachers that have been waiting to get jabbed for months.. 50+ years of age now eligible to make appointment for a vaccine.. i think some veterans 18&amp;up can recieve one as well. johnson and johnson one shot it available now in i think speedway for those who apply. sickle cell patients and dialysis patients can receive one now too. im fucking so happy!!!. Luckily enough I am A2 healthcare worker so I received my second shot a little over a week ago. Ready to get back to Normal!. If I lived in any other state, I‚Äôd be vaccinated already. Thank you Indiana Republicans for ignoring CDC guidelines regarding essential workers. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be my turn by 2022.. I know at Walmart you can call and get put on their waitlist regardless of age. And if they have any extras at the end of the day you get the call. My neighbor is 36 and just got his first dose yesterday.. No thank you!. Quit being a bitch Jesus lolol. Does he get to drive a lap around the speedway after he‚Äôs been vaccinated?. Amen! Good luck. Can I get an adrenochrome chaser with a Comet pizza?      /s\\n\\nThe sooner we get everyone vaccinated, the sooner we can reach herd immunity, the sooner we can squelch the mutations, the sooner we get back to some sense of normal (WTF that is).  Maybe we can have a national celebration July 4th or Labor Day?. Dude....why not be positive? You have options on how to be in life and you choose to denigrate another instead of lifting them up? I guess we all have the choice of being a wasted life or a life worth remembering. I hope you find the path that is best for you and yours. Take care!!. Stick with video games kid. Donald Trump isn\\'t president operating behind the scenes and Joe Biden isn\\'t animatronic. \\n\\nYou just seem like the kind of person who might need to be told that, for some reason. You give off that specific vibe.. I see you do not understand basic science..... Damn, you suck.. Fucking dumb ass. https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/should-you-get-jj-new-approved-covid-vaccine-effectiveness-explained.html just in case u wanna learn more. yes it isn‚Äôt 100 effective but better than doing nothing. and not sure what side effects ur talking about. i got the vaccine in december. i know of 10 people first hand who have had it... no unwanted side effects. i would look into how rna vaccines work and get out of ur echo chamber and back to reality. My husband registered about 30 minutes ago. No waiting and multiple sites with openings.. My boss just got her appointment about an hour ago for today at noon!  I hope to be in the next bundle, so I\\'m watching [OurShot](https://ourshot.in.gov/)!. Woo!. That‚Äôs great! My colleague‚Äôs wife just signed up and will get her shot this Friday. This is all very exciting.. I am scheduled to be vaccinated at the end of the month. Indiana gets a lot of bad rap, but I got friends in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Ohio....and those states are struggling to get people vaccinated\\n\\nGo Indiana!. That\\'s good news, I hope this number accelerates quickly.. We genuinely aren\\'t *that* far from herd immunity - that\\'s like 14% of the state\\'s population already and the pace is only quickening.\\n\\nI think 2021 will be remembered as a great year.. That\\'s great news. The VA hospital in Indy just went to any vets over the age of 18 can get the vaccine as of today.. My parents are both on their first dose and I was able to get both of mine because of my profession.  Just need to get my sister vaccinated and we‚Äôll be good to go lol.. Does Indiana have a website for signing up to receive communications on when your age range is eligible? The state we live in now has one, but I see we\\'ll be moving to Indiana before our group is eligible here.. Yay!!!!. I bet we‚Äôre capped anyway. Sleepy joe announced that every american will be able to get it by may. Who wants my dose? F that noise. Nobody questions the government doctors and big pharma that are very strongly pushing this? Not to mention the death rate for young people is under 2%. Only reason I would get it would be to not wear a mask anymore! And these dum dums in charge already made it clear that masks will still be required. Is it absolutely terrifying that everyone doesn‚Äôt realize the rights you are just willingly handing to the government.. Can teachers and support staff that are in direct contact every day of the week get the vaccines. Trust the government. Lining up out the door and around the block for a vaccine, but don‚Äôt you dare ask them for the tiniest inconvenience of wearing a mask. Good ol American selfishness.. 16% of the way there in a couple months, maybe we will have more than half before next winter?. Cool, can a young person get it yet? If not then that isnt a land mark.. There\\'s only a limited number of doses. It\\'s going to the people most at risk. Do you think it should just be a free-for-all? First come, first serve? Does that make any rational sense?. I was able to score one at Sea Mar in Tacoma yesterday, but they are first come first serve. I actually went at 11 am and there was only one person in front of me and I got number 160. Waited at home for four hours before getting called back in. They update their website daily to show if they have vaccines and which type.. 4 slots left for march 10th!. Do you have to be in phase 1b to take the appt?. Well yes.. but they just added prek-12 teachers, all school staff and licensed child care workers to that phase. Doth thee hath\\'t to beest in phase 1b to taketh the appt?\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\n\\n^(I am a bot and I swapp\\'d some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\\n\\nCommands: `!fordo`, `!optout`. Also, our total infected percentage remains one of the lowest in the country. Reported by covid19-projections machine learning model of infection estimates: \\n\\n[https://covid19-projections.com/maps-infections/](https://covid19-projections.com/maps-infections/#7d927fa9-15d9-48d4-8f15-1cf9b20316db). Thank-you for doing this. Thank-you for making this beautiful morning better. This is awesome news! Let\\'s keep it up! The fight isn\\'t over yet peeps.  We still have to keep taking this pandemic seriously till we can get more vaccinate.. I‚Äôm so hopeful. I‚Äôm at the Lumen Field simulation right now and it seems like they‚Äôll be able to move so many people through. Much faster than at SU Clinic or pharmacies.. As with all things, the rollout hasn\\'t been perfect, but I am super happy to be in WA during this pandemic. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t over, but the end is in sight - if we can continue to meet the task of distributing the increased vaccine supply from the federal government, there are better days in front of us.. awesome üôåüèº. Thanks for happier news.. Thank you for posting that. This made my morning :). I\\'m waiting for the guy to come in and give me the vaccine shot right now in seatlle\\n\\nJust got it! That is the finest needle that I\\'ve ever had! Didn\\'t even sting.. Serious question: at what point do we fully open up after the phases are through? We certainly won‚Äôt hit 100% vaccinated so what is the target percentage or goal? I‚Äôm imagining there is a point where Inslee would say okay we don‚Äôt need masks and everything is back to 100% capacity. Gotta say, it\\'s more than a little irritating I\\'m 63 years, 8 months old with 3 comorbidities and still at least a month or two away from being vaccine-eligible.. Making claims with numbers that are incomplete is silly. They have no idea how many were infected, so the claim becomes mute. If they were testing everyone for antibodies then they might have numbers that mean something and could harvest some meaningful data.. Yay us!!. Wooooo. This is great.. Its sad that so many people had to die from covid here. Look at India\\'s mortality - Other countries have much lower rates of death compared to the US by using repurposed medications but here the reluctance by the system as a whole to try minimal risk medications is astounding. Lack of medical agility and adherence to \"evidence based medicine\" (which is not a good thing in non-pandemic conditions) is partly to blame.. Washington is the state that gives young healthy people the vaccine while 90 yr olds are still on the wait  list.. You know what would be even better news???  If we opened everything back up like Texas did and stopped pretending that Covid is any more worse than the seasonal Flu.... Why the fuck are we not opening faster?. Fuck inslee. Who cares!. Please ban me from this so it stops notifying me and popping up. I have no problem trolling and saying things to upset people if have to. Damn reddit for making me see this.. This is good news. As someone who lives in clark county let\\'s please stay this way. I can\\'t wait for my vaccine, it will be better than Christmas and my birthday combined.. So I just found out I qualify through my work, but finding available times/days is like trying to buy music-festival tickets before they sell out (It\\'s been a nightmare). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOh well, i\\'ll just keep checking and i\\'ll get one eventually.. Please unlock 04440631, it‚Äôs been a month wait....not my fault.   Thanks. This sounds like a great milestone!\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this though. If you click through to his data, he makes a distinction about infections as \"infected individuals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not just those that took a COVID-19 test\" - this is how it comes up with ~1.5M, while the confirmed COVID-19 count (which is also on this page and all the pages with John\\'s Hopkins data analysis) is ~350k cumulative for WA state.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the difference? Who is assessed to be sars-cov-2 positive by some means other than a covid test?  Since it\\'s 4-5x higher, this seems like an important aspect.. Yet we still can\\'t figure out how to pay people Unemployment and ignore the fact that they keep putting Pandemic Moms back in adjudication for several weeks at a time. I\\'m coming up on 10 weeks on Tue same claim I have had since the Pandemic began. Everytime they approve Extended Benefits they put Parents of small children back in Adjudication to see of we are Able and Available for work. They are bankrupting and starving Parents of small children and no one is talking about it.. You can largely thank a the tribes we have here for these numbers. They\\'ve been killing it with vaccine distribution. Its been truly amazing to see!. People in Washington don\\'t want that crap injected into their bodies. U can have my shot.. So we can open 100% now safely?\\n\\nEdit: if not now, when?. At the doctors office (Yakima, Wa) today and was caught off guard by SIX (6) school buses full of what appeared to be migrant agricultural workers. We overheard two nurses talking, and concluded the men were all there for Covid19 vaccines? These were all healthy looking men in their 20\\'s and 30\\'s. My husband spoke up at one point and told the nurse that there are \"alot of elderly people and people with conditions still waiting to be vaccinated. My mother is one of them.\" He said. The nurse said \"well, this is a bunch of vaccine that is about to expire or has recently expired and so we are just trying to use it up quickly\". Jaw drop. Yes, she said that. We didnt speak again until the car.. noone cares. It‚Äôs Vermont not WA. Title is wrong. How do I sign up for a vaccine or whatever. This opinion is in the minority, you\\'re quite wrong.  Just because you don\\'t care doesn\\'t mean the rest of us don\\'t.. Great tips!. OMG. You just helped me get the vaccine tomorrow morning! Amazing work!. If you are a Veteran and didn‚Äôt see the sneaky little update in the email today: they opened the flood gates for veterans of all ages (but still prioritizing older/high risk veterans depending on their current inventory of vaccine).. I appreciate this! Still struggling to find my mom a vaccine anywhere in King or Snohomish county...fingers crossed that supply will keep increasing and looking forward to the future!. This is the site I went to. Watched it for few days while trying to get signed up with Pierce County health. Got first shot at Sea Mar last Thursday. The Wenatchee mass vaccination site has TONS of open appointments. I tell anyone i can about this site, especially random people if I hear them talking about how they‚Äôve been struggling to find a vaccine or how hard the process is. Also, side note...if you are a vet and use VA Hosiptial, their appointment went live yesterday, im getting my 1st this afternoon. Try Sea Mar. They do walk-in only, no appointments. On their website, they update daily and show which locations currently have vaccines and which vaccine. I was able to get my client and his wife to do it and they both get their first Moderna shot.. There\\'s a find a vaccine wa Facebook group. Anyone over 70 gets assigned a volunteer to help them through the process (on top of the normal chat).  Try there!. Scroll toward the bottom. As of the time of my posting this comment, there are Pfizer doses available at:\\nBurien, Des Moines, Seattle, Federal Way, and White Center. Good luck, and I wish the best for your mom. My mother got her 2nd Pfizer dose last week and feels great.. https://www.seamar.org/covid-vaccine.html. If schools absolutely need to open then I‚Äôm glad that teachers are getting vaccinated but I can‚Äôt help feeling fucking shafted as a fast food worker. Our restaurant didn‚Äôt shut down once and I‚Äôve been dealing with unmasked people in my drive-in for this whole year. Feels awful to be pushed down the list even further for schools to open when summer break is right around the corner.. It seems so wrong that a 55 year old bus driver with type two diabetes and heart disease can‚Äôt get vaccinated in Washington. At this point, I think it might be worth skipping the line if you are at grave Risk of dying from COVID and work with the public.. WA teacher here. I just started in-person teaching this week, still unvaccinated. 144 students in my room every two days. It‚Äôs pretty risky and pretty scary.. Does this include other school staff like para educators, cooks, custodians, bus drivers, etc? They are just as exposed as teachers- in some cases, more.. I mean, I fully support vaccinating teachers, but seriously Inslee, hurry it up for the essential workers. So many other states are well into vaccinating grocery store employee already. Where are the appointments at? All locations in the south end are not available.. Hello, what about fucking bus drivers and other public transportation people. Carting around nasty ass MOFOs for the last year.. I\\'m curious how many people this represents; it doesn\\'t look like this is broken out in any of the state reports I\\'ve seen.. Now that they forced all the teachers back into the classroom they decide it\\'s time to vaccinate them. No shit sherlock.. Why not open it to teachers *and* to people with underlying conditions?. this is really great news! It\\'s about time that our teachers be able to get vaccinated :). Does anyone know if this is restricted to K-12, or if higher ed is included? I can\\'t seem to find that info anywhere.. I‚Äôm glad early childhood educators are finally being seen as a priority. They usually get the shit end of the stick.. Teachers Unions, your move.. but what about **(combination of several comorbidities and occupation that interacts with the public)**. Toddler teacher here. After we briefly closed last year, we‚Äôve been in person with children too young to wear masks since June. You can‚Äôt socially distance two year olds. We are incredibly lucky to have been contacted yesterday, and someone is coming to vaccinate all of us today. Please remember us teachers that cannot be distanced or protected from the children, and are with them year round when you talk about how we don‚Äôt need to be vaccinated yet.. We\\'re in vaccine phase 1-b right now, correct?. High school senior here- this is an immense breath of fresh air. Win-win situation.\\n\\nNo more hand-wringing over whether or not last March was the last time I got to see my peers. Phew.. Happy for the those that just leap frogged everyone with co-morbidities and are at a much higher risk of severe infection or death.... Super excited that many/most of the teachers will be vaccinated by the time my baby goes to daycare! I have been super anxious about the possibility of sending my 5-month old to-be to daycare during the pandemic.. Why should young healthy teachers who are going to be working from home until the fall be prioritized for a vaccine? There has been numerous school districts recently that have said they won\\'t be returning for in person learning until Fall 2021. Monster shout out to the group that has done the bare minimum this entire pandemic. Way to hold five year olds hostage.. Do substitute teachers count under this? Looking at the guidance I could make the argument yes and no.. This would be awesome if any teachers could find freaking appointments. It‚Äôs been almost impossible to schedule down in Clark County/Vancouver area since tier 1b opened up. \\nNot much point in opening up eligibility if there‚Äôs already too much demand for not enough vaccines.. I\\'m a childcare worker and I haven\\'t stopped working since this started.. Because reopening schools for in-person learning is an enormous priority.. Young healthy teachers? What school district are you working in? Most of the ones I know that don‚Äôt wanna go back are over 55, mini with comorbidities.. But many are going back.. Cause they work with our kids. And many school districts are forcing teachers back to school even without them vaccinated, which is dangerous.\\n\\nPlus, everyone is going to be able to get the vaccine with the next 3-4 months anyways. If some teachers who are still going to be teaching from home get to jump the line great good for them its a nice little perk for them choosing a profession that is vital to our society but generally undercompensated to a large degree.. At this point, vaccinate teachers.  Forcibly enter their homes and deliver the vaccine in the middle of the night.  Anything, to stop the ~~children\\'s~~ tantrums.. Good luck getting an appointment though.  Most places also don\\'t seem to have updated to allow teachers through their screening either.. I got an appointment in Spokane for Thursday, my husband on Friday. My BIL is getting his this week too we all scheduled today. We are going through CHAS in Spokane, and all the screening asks is whether or not you are eligible. My brother got scheduled for tomorrow, my wife this weekend. On different  sides of the state today. Might have to go out of your way to get one. Like in another county.. I guess I am hoping now with the JNJ vaccine approved, things will open up very soon.. I love that the grocery employees, agricultural workers, and fishing industry was immediately upset in that article. It‚Äôs terrible and hilarious. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt think they are _wrong_ either. Are the majority of WA kids going to see a classroom before next fall? Will schools reopen for 2 weeks and then close for summer? Because that would simply mean we vaccinated a lot of low-risk people working from home. \\n\\nI can see how that would piss off a grocery worker whose been dealing with maskless customers for a year. On the other hand, I‚Äôve been terrified for my friends teaching in person in Texas. Their Facebook posts were awful ‚Äî it was clearly unsafe and it has been a huge relief as they got vaccinated. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they open up summer schools to help the kids get caught up especially since kids backslide during summer break during normal times. \\n\\nThe point of this ramble is that vaccine distraction is fundamentally unfair because everyone deserves to be vaccinated and has really good reasons why they should go first. The problem is that the pie is too small and waiting sucks.. I‚Äôm so glad! But it also looks like this was because Biden demanded it. Not because inslee prioritized educators lives.. No age restriction, correct? I haven\\'t seen anything that indicates one way or another.. Does this apply to instructors at colleges and universities as well?. This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-state-teachers-childcare-workers-can-now-get-vaccinated-gov-inslee-says/) reduced by 89%. (I\\'m a bot)\\n*****\\n&gt; Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday afternoon said teachers and licensed child care workers could seek doses of COVID-19 vaccines immediately, assenting to new directions from the federal government.\\n\\n&gt; &amp;quot;We will continue the current state plans and goals to focus on those most at risk, including older adults and those facing the greatest equity gaps,&amp;quot; Inslee said, adding that he would soon announce when vaccine priority would open to include those who work in grocery stores, farmworkers, food processors, bus drivers and corrections workers.\\n\\n&gt; Just last week, a group of state lawmakers from Seattle tried to lobby state and city officials to speed up the process for educators as Seattle Public Schools and its teachers union remained at an impasse over reopening.\\n\\n\\n*****\\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/lwig5f/all_washington_state_teachers_child_care_workers/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~561502 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM\\'s and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **work**^#1 **state**^#2 **vaccine**^#3 **Washington**^#4 **Educators**^#5. Just got my appointment yesterday! Stoked :D. This is so ridiculous, we got the elderly and heathcare workers, open the flood gates to anyone and get as many people across the state vaccinated as possible. That\\'s the fastest way out of this.. I wonder if this applies to people who work with kids in non-educational settings. I\\'m a dance teacher and have been very nervous since the kids went back to school.. I don‚Äôt think so either and that‚Äôs because this reads like it isn‚Äôt an education first decision. This is a daycare priority decision.. As per https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/Articles/ID/2657/Statement-on-Federal-School-and-Childcare-Vaccination-Plan - it looks like No. No.. I\\'m glad they can get vaccine now, my kid has become depressed this last year .\\n\\nStill annoyed essential workers like grocery cant get vaccine if under 50 though . They can\\'t zoom call or use teams .\\n\\nAnd hair salons, barbers? \\n\\nThey can\\'t 6ft distance seems most at risk job in my opinion .. Thank god. I wouldn‚Äôt want them to get infected over a zoom class.. ... As snarky as your remark is, id like to just tell you that not all teachers and educators are online. We\\'ve had students since fall. Thanks.. This is a really unnecessary shitty comment.. I think there aren‚Äôt a lot of opportunities now but there will be more later on. \\n\\nSupply is constrained and they are working on balancing sites. My guess is that opportunities will explode in by early/mid April based on supply and new tiers.. I know Kaiser Permanente has a volunteer coordinator answering these inquiries - you could contact member services to get the info, probably.. Yes. There is a volunteer form on this website https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/how-you-can-help. Mass vaccination events need help with crowd control/greeting/check-in/etc and I receive emails at work about helping with these needs. The most recent request I got said that they only wanted clinical volunteers (a range from medical assistants to nurses to MDs) and had no need for additional non-clinical staff. Perhaps check with your county as well as any local tribe or other entity holding vaccine clinics. Some clinics will give volunteers a vaccine if they want it. Expect a background check.. I‚Äôm in Phase 1B3 and it feels as if WA is going snail pace with the vaccine rollout. Biden announced that everyone should be getting vaccinated by May. üôÑ. Nothing 100%, but I have a good estimate, and I think we‚Äôll likely be moving forward next week at the latest, but quite possibly this week.\\n\\nSo the DOH mentioned that they intended to move forward to the next tier once 50% of currently eligible people have gotten their first shot. According to the vaccine tab on [the DOH Covid Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard), as of Feb 27th, we‚Äôve delivered ~1,080,000 first doses. Now, [here on page 46](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/820-112-InterimVaccineAllocationPrioritization.pdf) we were given a table of how many people are estimated to be eligible in each phase (and this estimate should be what they‚Äôre using to determine that 50% number), and we can see here that 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 combine to be ~2,300,000 people eligible right now, making the point where we move on at 1,115,000 first doses, which means we only need ~70,000 more from where we were on Feb 27th. Now the most recent update we‚Äôve gotten on first/second dose split was [here](https://twitter.com/wadepthealth/status/1364641773667155971?s=21), putting us at around 22,000 first doses a day, which puts us on pace to hit that 50% number by March 3rd. Now keep in mind, this is even without the J&amp;J vaccine\\n\\nNow, I imagine there‚Äôs some worry at the DOH about how willing people are to take the J&amp;J vaccine given its lower published efficacy since this seems to be a major public health push everywhere, so given that we‚Äôre already about to hit a point where we were initially looking to move on to 1B2 and we‚Äôre already about to get ~60,000 J&amp;J doses, they may feel some pressure to open 1B2 to avoid a bottleneck in demand. \\n\\nNow one more thing, if you noticed from the table presenting how big each phase is, you‚Äôll see that 1B2 is only ~95,000 people and we‚Äôre looking to be able to do ~82,000 first doses this week once J&amp;J is factored in (I know J&amp;J is only one dose, but for my purposes here it makes sense to consider it a first dose), and given that we‚Äôre definitely not going to get 100% uptake among those eligible in 1B2, it looks like we‚Äôre about to zoom through 1B2 very fast, so fast that I could see them doing something like opening up 1B2 and 1B3 simultaneously and just reserve a certain amount of the doses for 1B2 only (like how they pivoted to make all the mass vaccination sites only 2nd doses recently for about a week to catch us up on 2nd doses), I could see them open up to 1B2 for mass vaccination sites and open up to 1B3 for everywhere else. This last bit is only speculation but I imagine we won‚Äôt spend much time in 1B2 before moving on to 1B3 since our rate of vaccination is very fast compared to the amount of 1B2 people, less than a week‚Äôs worth\\n\\n**TLDR: Very soon, I would say next week at the latest for 1B2 and 1B3 should follow very shortly, if not at the same time**. I\\'m 1B4, and am looking forward to learning more.\\n\\nEdited to add - so, I called KP, my health care insurer, to ask about this. The rep asked me a few questions, said, \"let me talk to my supervisor\" and put me on hold. When she came back, she said, \"are you available this afternoon to come down to Renton?\" By 5pm, I got my first jab!. I‚Äôm not even in phase 1, might honestly be in phase 3 (healthy, young, works remotely). Not complaining, just glad to know what the timeframe looks like.  \\n  \\nEdit: here is a link to some useful info from wa doh: https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/VaccinationPhasesInfographic.pdf. Slightly dated but I started a nice thread on this a week ago:  \\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWA/comments/lqmrv0/when\\\\_might\\\\_we\\\\_move\\\\_to\\\\_1b\\\\_tier\\\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusWA/comments/lqmrv0/when_might_we_move_to_1b_tier_2/)  \\n\\n\\nAlso the State DOH site has 65+ at 47.9% as of 2/27. It was at 44.2% as of 2/24. So that is moving up quickly and could very well be at or beyond the 50% mark right now.. Vaccinate teachers ASAP. Thanks everyone for chiming in with helpful information along with links! This info gives me a teensy tiny bit of piece of mind.. Totally just guessing, but I\\'d say tier 2 in the next 2 weeks, tier 3 in April when the vaccine supply really ramp up.. I think you\\'re confusing tiers with phases. I think April is realistic for Phase 2.. \\\\&gt; At peak operations and supply permitting, the mass vaccination site could administer 21,000 vaccinations each day or 150,000 vaccinations every week to the entire region.\\n\\nThat is awesome! Just in time for J&amp;J and an increase supply of mRNA vaccines to come out in the next few weeks. Great news.. This sounds really promising. Is there reason to believe that Seattleites could be vaccinated well ahead of the rest of the country?  At 150,000 per week, I feel like that could happen rather quickly (assuming those numbers can stay on track).. Unpopular opinion here but King County has been doing a good job vaccinating in the last month or so. \\n\\nYes it‚Äôs not easy to get an appt. Yes, not everyone is eligible yet. And it‚Äôs still confusing. \\n\\nBut the vaccination dashboard shows the 90% of total doses used from week to week. The problem is _supply_ not eligibility. I don‚Äôt think anecdotes about young healthy cousins receiving vaccinations in other states is a great benchmark. \\n\\nWe are only getting so much vaccine at the moment and demand is high. And Seattle has low vaccine hesitancy so demand is even intense. There‚Äôs a county in AZ with no restrictions because of a lack of interest (and disproportionate supply allocations). That won‚Äôt be the case here. \\n\\nI think we should be getting close to opening the next eligibility tier but unfortunately supply is limited.. Will there also be a mass boost in vaccines available? Seems like vaccine supply has been the issue so far.\\nEdit for typo.. How the fuck is it taking us so long to figure this out in Seattle. It feels like everyone in NYC is somehow vaccinated and my parents who are in their 50s still cant get a damn vaccine.. I‚Äôll be wearing my Lynch jersey, getting my vaccine at the home of the Seahawks!. Meanwhile tribal vaccinations are pretty much complete. So much so that they are starting to vaccinate nearby communities.\\n\\n It\\'s the white population that is still trying to figure this shit out.. I wouldn\\'t say \\'complete\\' but they have been able to move through their vaccination plans quickly but that doesn\\'t mean everyone has been vaccinated as the plan phases  usually advance when you have hit a certain percentage threshold of the estimated population of a phase.  Because their populations are more known to the tribe, they know exactly who has been vaccinated and who hasn\\'t so they can move with far more certainty.\\n\\nI\\'ll give you a hint: tribal vaccine allocations come from the federal government directly, not the state.  If tribes can still get vaccine allocations going forward that will go into someone\\'s arm in WA, I say more power to them - especially in more rural areas of WA.  In fact, the state should have contracted with the tribes to keep their mass vaccination sites going instead of reinventing the wheel all over WA.\\n\\nMy tribe is currently vaccinating (over 16 y.o.) all tribal members and their immediate household (regardless of race), the thousands of tribal employees and their households (regardless of race), all the employees of a neighboring school district.. Not sure what race had to do with absolutely anything but cool?. Depends on the tribe. Also, the tribal communities wouldn\\'t have had a vaccine at all without the \"white population\" inventing it but I don\\'t know why you\\'d make that kind of comparison. We\\'re all working together and some tribes are generously giving doses out to non-tribal people. Not sure why you\\'d see this as an opportunity to dunk on white people.. Look on the bright side, this could be a good indicator of moving to the next vaccine phase next week then. Wasting open appointment slots and potentially throwing away unused vaccines is the absolute dumbest thing we could be doing right now. I understand the state wants to be equitable in how they distribute the vaccines, but the quickest way out of this pandemic is getting as many shots in as many arms as quickly as possible. If there‚Äôs still open appointment slots the day of, maybe even the day before, let anybody sign up for them.. This happened in Wenatchee a few weeks back and all the appointments got filled eventually.  And that was over 1000 appointments.. Good to hear Spokane is working hard to get vaccines to it\\'s citizens that need it most, not fear it most.. J&amp;J does not gave to be frozen and remain refrigerated for some time. Less likely to be wasted for that reason at least. Maybe if people had just follow es d the ccx rules re making &amp; distance we would all be in a better place. But, if we follow them now until Memorial Day, this will be a great summer. If not, it will be a  good Thanksgiving. Our choice.. I just returned from Gonzaga where I got my first shot. After three weeks of trying, I got thru online last evening. Chas was overwhelmed in the weeks prior and it was frustrating to say the least. They partnered up w GU volunteers and everything seems to be running smoothly. Hopefully the distribution of vaccine will speed up to the demand. Well I would hope so. Reach out to seniors And those eligible first, who might not be as good at hitting the refresh button on their computer browser 8000 times a day. Or alternately, send them on down to Southwest Washington where we have not had any appointments open for longer than two minutes since this started. No shit. I have to agree, this is kinda like a \"no shit\" headline.. My thoughts are that some people are blowing things out of proportion, where I got my first immunization they had all of the appointments filled and now we have just made appointments for our second dose. Both in a timely manner and as orderly as possible for the circumstances. I think they are doing a great job, it is just frustrating for some that are not eligible yet to understand the system and why it is being done the way it is. All I can say is have patience they will get to you sooner probably than later.. I\\'m trying to patience I really am, but after working with a group of people yesterday at amazon, most of them pull their mask off to talk to each other, one of them screamed (WITH HER MASK OFF!) My sister was infected covid, my patience is thin for the republicans in Spokane. \\n\\n\\nVaccines, Big Pharma, Government, and the Upper Middle Class don\\'t work for the working class people. This slow roll out shows it.. Good news! I wish they had a better estimate of the throughput than ‚Äúthousands‚Äù, but any extra sites will be especially useful as J&amp;J starts delivering and as Moderna and Pfizer ramp up production. They can keep it. I got no intention of getting it as #freeAmerican. So looking at your posting history - you are threadshitting on a Washington subreddit from Los Angeles, and you\\'ve also posted similar anti-mask, anti-vaxx bullshit in local Coronavirus subreddits in LA, FL and the UK. Great way to try to get the attention that your daddy didn\\'t give you. Enjoy the downvotes.. Lol, literally no way you are actually an American.. There is some line cutting going on for sure.\\n\\nBut more so, there are people who are opportunistically going to vaccination sites and seeing if there are extra vaccines left at the end of the day, that they need to essentially \"use or lose\".  The first group may be taking someone in regions spot, the second group is just taking a vaccine that will be otherwise lost.\\n\\nHere\\'s two things that help me from wasting time getting angry:    \\n1) From a broad perspective, the goal is to get as many people as possible the vaccine as soon as possible.  A broadly vaccinated population is what is eventually going to bring down case counts to a level we can open up society again.  So that\\'s why they are focused more on getting vaccines out than policing.\\n\\n2) People who are being selfish on cutting corners to get themselves vaccinated first, are probably the same people do selfish things to spread the virus in general.  So in my opinion, getting the \"selfish idiot\" group prioritized is probably going to be super efficient in driving down counts and opening things up.. &gt;I thought I had heard that you had to be a resident of the county where the vaccine is being given, but apparently that is not the case.\\n\\nIn an ideal world, yes, but this doesn\\'t usually play out. I booked my friend an appointment in Pierce even though he lives in King. I couldn\\'t find him an appointment in King. He\\'s a 72-year-old Black cancer survivor. I filled out his questionnaire for him and told no lies. He wasn\\'t turned away.\\n\\nSome sites will turn away people who don\\'t live in the immediate area, but most won\\'t.. The state has also caused some of these problems. When it opens up to teachers, there will be mass vaccination sites along I-5 and in Spokane. Which means teachers who live everywhere else will end up driving out of county because there aren\\'t sites set up in their area.. &gt;\\tI thought I had heard that you had to be a resident of the county where the vaccine is being given, but apparently that is not the case. \\n\\nI looked this up a month or so ago and the report was that the state advised to stay in state. There was nothing about staying in county though. Not even a ‚Äúplease stay in county‚Äù statement. \\n\\nMy dad is eligible and I had to get him a shot in another country and I have no problems with that. The whole allocation process has been a shit show IMO and the state asked for this behavior as a result of the allocation. \\n\\nWhen you‚Äôre eligible wouldn‚Äôt feel bad if you need to go out of county.. The short answer is that you do not HAVE to be a resident of a county to get vaccinated there. It is recommended because of the allocations you mentioned that you try to stick with your own county. However, it is very hard (at least for me) to tell an 85-year old senior with health complications who has been trying for months now to get an appointment for the vaccine that they should not accept an available appointment in another county if they can get it and can get there. Some counties seem to have more appointment availability than others, perhaps because of lower demand, less community outreach, more complicated scheduling that people aren\\'t figuring out, or some other factor. I do not know about Lewis county\\'s allocation versus other counties\\' allocations, but there are still many eligible seniors in most counties who are still looking for vaccines because demand in general has outstripped supply. Many of them are spending time every day trying to get an appointment somewhere, anywhere.. This is pretty common and in my opinion a result of poor national planning. My parents (Illinois) are driving 3 hours to get the vaccine tomorrow. \\n\\nThey‚Äôre eligible in their county, but their town made an agreement with the county they‚Äôd be distributing vaccines themselves without the county help, so anyone in said town is not allowed to go to a county vaccine site. The town hasn‚Äôt put any info on any website with how to get a vaccines so my dad stayed up midnight last week to get an appointment anywhere in the state as soon as they were eligible.. I think the vaccines are supposed to be allocated by eligible population, but there are distribution issues that complicate this. They‚Äôre only giving vaccines to specific hospitals and organizations‚Äîboth because of distribution logistics and the need for cold storage. And not all counties are alike on this. The bigger population centers are going to have bigger and better facilities and thus more vaccines. It sucks, but it‚Äôs hard to avoid.\\n\\nAs for people leaving their county, I think it‚Äôs mostly just eligible people looking anywhere for a shot. My mom‚Äîin Snohomish County‚Äîgot her shots in King County. But that was mostly because her doctor is there, so we searched primarily at King County sites.. Waiting for the vaccine is like getting through the last two weeks of pregnancy.  You know it\\'s going to end at some point but it\\'s so close it\\'s all you can think about.\\n\\nWe\\'ve been distracting ourselves for a long time. We can do it for a bit longer. It also wouldn\\'t be a waste of energy to rant and rave about how frustrating it is not to have it yet, because it won\\'t be but a little while before you won\\'t need to rant and rave anymore. \\n\\nIt\\'s something to look forward to. Hang in there world.. Here Kittitas County has a population around 50k. The vaccine waitlist website had to be shut down when over 100k people tried to register.  I know people drive to Ellensburg\\'s DMV because its quicker even when driving 100 miles to get here, but come on!  We don\\'t need people with the means to do so to come here and take a vaccine away from people it was allocated for.\\n\\nI also know people are lying on questionnaires. A friend posted on IG about getting her 1st shot and my wife asked how, she said \" I just answered the questions and they said I qualify\".\\n\\nShe\\'s incredibly fat, said she has asthma, and \"lives in a multi-generational home\". She is 25 and her and her husband live with her dad who is in his 40s!  But as another commenter said, she is one that would do selfish things to spread the virus in general and in fact already has before. \\n\\n I fear though with people like that, that they think it magically makes them immune from getting and spreading the virus to others so they can do what ever they want. She\\'s already joked about driving 2 hours to surprise someone at their front door and was baffled why they were anxious when she showed up.. The vaccine is being made available in willy nilly fashion with some areas receiving plenty of supply and some receiving very little. Instead of making people go on a wild goose chase in search of a vaccine, why haven\\'t they created a central database where people can sign up and wait for an invitation to get a shot? Far more fair and equitable than having people play Wac-a-mole to get a shot. But then the real truth about who\\'s actually getting the vaccine might come out.. Call the vancouver clinic on mill plain in vancouver wa. They are and have been vaccinating the elder and mid 30s. Give them a call and see what they say. My county has about 25% more vaccinated persons than the amount of vaccine that has been allocated to the county. Vaccine tourism.... ... So this location is trying to vaccine about 4k people this month. I dont know how you can get on but yea. If you‚Äôre not at risk get in line. Is this your attempt at humor, sarcasm, or what?'"
