"['Abstract\n\nThe type 2 coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and produces pneumonia with pulmonary alveolar collapse. In some cases it also causes sepsis and septic shock. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vitamin C (Vit C), Vitamin E (Vit E), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and Melatonin (MT) increase the intracellular content of GSH, kidnap free radicals and protect DNA, proteins in the cytosol and lipids in cell membranes. Pentoxifylline (Px) has anti-inflammatory activities. Here we evaluate the effect of Vit C, Vit E, NAC, and MT plus Px in COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe pneumonia. 110 patients of either sex were included. They were divided into five groups with 22 patients each. Group 1 received Vit C+Px, group 2 Vit E+Px, group 3 NAC+Px, group 4 MT+Px, and group 5 only Px. Oxidative stress (OS) markers such as lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and nitrites (NO2-) were evaluated in plasma. The antioxidant therapy improved the survival scores including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), the Acute Physiology and chronic Health Evaluation II (Apache II), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), the Critical Illness Risk Score, Launched during COVID-19 crisis (COVIDGRAM) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We found that LPO was elevated (p≤0.04) and TAC (p≤0.03), NO2-\xa0(p≤0.04) and inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6, p≤0.01) C reactive protein (CRP, p≤0.01) and procalcitonin (PCT, p≤0.05) were diminished in COVID-19 patients upon admission to the hospital. The different antioxidants reversed this alteration at the end of the treatment. The treatment with antioxidant supplements such as Vit C, E, NAC, and MT plus Px could decelerate the aggressive and lethal development of COVID-19. Antioxidant therapy can be effective in this pandemia since it improves the survival scores including SOFA, Apache II, SAPS II, COVIDGRAM, GCS by lowering the LPO, IL-6, CRP, PCT and increasing systemic TAC and NO2']",[0.0],[1.0],['2021-03-03 21:39:29'],t2_2ouo0ilp,1.0,['COVID19'],['Antioxidants and pentoxifylline as coadjuvant measures to standard therapy to improve prognosis of patients with pneumonia by COVID-19'],[4],[0],[2],[316847],['2021-03-03 13:39:07'],4.0

So if you\'re currently preparing a witty response to my concerns please excuse yourself from this thread.***\n\nMy two concerns are:\n\n1. I can\'t help but feel a little suspicious about the fact that 4 or 5 manufacturers/producers/labs announced the completion of their new vaccine all within a span of a month or so. Given that each product operates using a unique method, I find it a little strange that they all became available at relatively the same time. I\'m not necessarily claiming that there must have been some conspiracy or fowl-play involved here, but I would certainly appreciate if anyone could explain the coincidental logistics of how that happened.\n2. I\'m more than happy to drop point number 1 if these vaccine weren\'t so rushed. Now I understand that this pandemic ushered in an incredible global effort to develop this vaccine as soon as possible, but I distinctly remember last February when health ministers around the world said that this vaccine would take at least 18-24 months to develop. I hardly ever fall for conspiracies but given what this pandemic has done to the global economies, governments obviously have an immense incentive to push out a vaccine as quickly as possible. And as far as I can tell, there\'s no way of truly knowing whether or not any steps were skipped during the development of this vaccine.\n\nI live in Dubai, UAE and the Sinopharm (China) and Pfizer-BioNTech (US) vaccines are becoming almost readily available for the general public. Furthermore, many companies are pushing for their employees to take the vaccine (obviously to limit any further paid sick leaves). I\'m not completely shutting down the possibility of taking the vaccine but I would definitely like these points addressed before I take it.\n\nLooking forward to your responses!\n\nEDIT: It also doesn\'t help that the Sinopharm chairman and another director resigned last week for ""personal reasons.""']",[0.0],[6.0],['1/20/21 12:28'],t2_3rdxvvyy,6.0,,,,,,,,

This is to be compared to the  0.19 per 100000 dying from COVID-19 and that are not vaccinated in that  age group, as per the above table. Hence the death rate of this age  group increased by 260 during this 5-week period of the vaccination  process, as compared to their natural COVID-19 death rate.\n\nI fail to see how 0.05% is significantly above the natural death rate for this age group or why it's alarming. The natural death rate is going to be above the death rate caused exclusively by covid for this age group.\n\nThe true conspiracy to look for in my eyes is who has something to gain by pushing this absolute nonsense to the masses."", 'Text:\n\nA crucial wing of the immune system appears to be just as good at recognising all the new coronavirus variants, a study has found.\n\nIn laboratory tests, T-cell responses in those vaccinated or previously infected with coronavirus were largely unaffected by each of the key variants. This included the new Brazilian variant, found in small numbers in the UK last week.\n\nThe new findings suggest that even if people are able to be reinfected by the variants, some of which are believed to partially evade our first immune response, the body will have key tools for preventing severe disease.\n\nHowever, the scientists behind the findings cautioned that the protective abilities of the  T-cell response remained to be proven in the field.\n\n“If you have a good T-cell response you may not be able to prevent infection, but you should be able to soften the blow,” said Professor Alessandro Sette, from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “That is important. The opposite scenario would have been really concerning, if the new variants had been able to evade both the antibody response and the T-cell response.”\n\nAfter infection or vaccination, people produce antibodies specific to the coronavirus. These recognise and latch on to part of the spike the virus uses to infect cells — effectively blocking it.\n\n“Basically you create a wall and the virus bounces off that wall,” said Sette. “This is sterilizing immunity.”\n\nOne of the concerns about new variants, particularly those from South  Africa and Brazil, is they contain a mutation that changes the shape of  the spike, meaning they evade antibodies built up against the old version.\n\nHowever, that is only the first line of defence. We know from vaccine trials that even if people do become infected following vaccination, they are still at least 50 per cent less likely to develop severe disease compared to those who were infected without being vaccinated.\n\nThe second line of defence that helps them fight off Covid comes in part from T-cells, which are harder to trick.\n\n“One of the things that T-cells do is kill infected cells or create an antiviral response,” said Sette. “So, if you have T-cells you may not prevent the infection, but you may lessen the severity of the disease. You may also shorten the duration of a disease.”\n\nUnlike antibodies, these T-cells home in on a larger portion of the virus’s spike, meaning it has to change more significantly to elude them.\n\nBecause each person’s T-cells choose these larger sections of viral proteins at random, it also means it’s harder for the virus to evolve in a way that it evades them at a population level. Even if it finds a way to trick one person, that does not mean it will trick the person they infect.\n\nSette’s research, published ahead of peer review, used blood taken from people who had received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or been naturally infected. It showed that while their antibody response might be reduced, their T-cell response held up well.\n\n“Putting two and two together you would imagine that if you have a good T-cell response you would be able to lessen symptoms.”\n\nThe findings will be comforting for Britain’s vaccine strategy, however public health officials cautioned it was still important to prevent the spread of new variants. No protection is perfect, and any variant that can infect people better — even only mildly — will risk slowing the raising of lockdown.\n\nSette said it will also be key to see what happens in the real world. Currently some cities in South America that are believed to have had high infection levels are seeing a second spike in hospitalisations, apparently caused by the new Brazilian variant.\n\nThis  includes places like Leticia in Colombia, where studies suggest that around 60 per cent of the population were previously infected with the old variant. This at least suggests that some people are being reinfected and ending up in hospital.']","[0.0, 0.0]","[31.0, 70.0]","['2021-03-03 17:17:58', '3/3/21 16:37']",t2_4g4xj7dq,101.0,['Coronavirus'],"['T-cells recognise new Covid variants, study finds']",[1000],[0],[93],[2365354],['2021-03-03 08:34:53'],1000.0

"['I’m not an expert in vaccines, but I do know a thing or two about talking to antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Don’t get bogged down in making broad claims about vaccines as a whole, because then all it takes is one loophole to “discredit” your entire argument. She isn’t an antivaxxer, so the last thing you want to do is to send her down the rabbit hole (which is a *very* slippery slope.) You aren’t talking about all vaccines here, you’re talking about a literal handful of vaccines in particular, so focus on the specifics of the COVID vaccines. \n\nThere’s been a fair bit of misinformation going around on Instagram / Facebook, including what appear to be fake screen shots warning of fertility impacts, but as far as I can tell they’re just that: fake. The EUAs and information for prescribers and recipients for each vaccine are public, and while there is some language about birth defects etc. the context is important because it’s specifically regarding what legally must be reported to VAERS with *any* vaccine — not evidence of side effects — and the prevalence of pregnancy-related issues in all people, vaccinated or not. The EUAs also include fun information like the fact that only 0.3% of recipients in the trial had any sort of adverse reaction (swelling, pain, etc.), but also that 0.2% of people who got the *placebo* reported the same side effects. \n\nThe other reason you don’t want to start citing other vaccines is that the COVID vaccines (in particular the Modern and Pfizer ones) *are* somewhat new technology. It’s totally normal and OK to be nervous about that, but despite the misinformation, it’s not as scary as it sounds. No, they don’t modify your DNA — they use modified RNA (different than DNA) as a vector to “teach” your body how to recognize the characteristic protein spike of COVID-19 and manufacture the antibody — which isn’t at all unlike how traditional vaccines that use a dead virus work. There’s also this idea floating around that it isn’t even a vaccine because it doesn’t prevent you from getting infected. While it’s true that there isn’t proof that they prevent infection, they do prevent the virus from replicating and creating symptoms, and that’s literally one of the ways that some traditional vaccines operate (search term: therapeutic vaccine). They’ve also shown to be almost 100% effective in eliminating serious cases — that “95%” number you see floating around is very misleading because it’s looking at all cases — including totally asymptomatic ones or ones that amount to the sniffles (the vast majority). It *might* not stop the virus from getting into your body, but it *will* make you drastically less likely to get sick from it. \n\nThere’s no evidence I can find of reproductive effects from any of the COVID vaccines — but there *is* evidence of reproductive effects from getting a symptomatic case COVID virus. \n\nThe most important thing in all of this though isn’t the information — it’s how you communicate with her. “How to Win Friends and Influence People” is, IMO, a terribly overrated book that everyone should read because the core tenants are spot on. The best way to win an argument is not to have one. Empathize with her, listen to her, and don’t preach, criticize or shun. I’ve spent more hours than I can count purposefully spelunking into the QAnon / anti-vaccine rabbit hole (along with most other conspiracy theories) and it’s definitely one of the most dangerous ones I’ve come across for the amount of brain power it takes to parse out and refute the various claims. I’m naturally an information junky who’s skeptical of literally everything and actually enjoys and does this kind of thing professionally, and while I might have more of a natural immunity to it than some, I don’t fault people for falling down the rabbit hole. The way they twist / misuse information is *masterful.* \n\nOof, that was a lot more long-winded and rambly than I intended.  Sorry. \n\nIf you want to show her information, I’d stick to the primary sources like the EUAs because it’s harder to just say “fake news” (or whatever), but if you want some background info for yourself there’s a great podcast called “Conspirituality” that touches on this stuff from a hippie wellness perspective, and on the flip side Ron Bailey over at Reason Magazine has done some great reporting on this stuff. He’s consistently had some of the most clear-headed and level takes since the beginning of the pandemic. \n\nGood luck!\n\n(BTW, it’s “affect” in this case. The best way to remember it is think “a” for “action.” An affect is an action, and an effect is a thing — there’s some tricky exceptions, but TBH it’s not worth worrying about. Just use that rule and 99.5% of the time you’ll be correct, and if you’re wrong only 0.1% of people or so will notice anyway).']",[0.0],[13.0],['2021-03-01 23:25:47'],t2_4uxar,13.0,,,,,,,,

Data on recent months in the US is notably still incomplete, but there are no preliminary signs of increased rates.\n\nA December 2020 [Newsweek article](https://www.newsweek.com/suicide-rate-dropped-lowest-level-since-1999-last-year-trend-may-not-continue-2020-1556846) explained:\n\n&gt;""We do not yet know about suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic because the United States does not collect suicide data in real time, therefore, claims about increasing suicide rates during COVID-19 are not based in current available data and are unfounded,"" said American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Chief Medical Officer Christine Moutier in a Tuesday statement. ""Emerging data from several countries show no evidence of increased suicide rates during the first few months of the pandemic.""\n\nAnother recent discussion of the issue was presented in a January 2021 article in *The New York Times Magazine,* entitled ""[Will the Pandemic Result in More Suicides?""](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/magazine/will-the-pandemic-result-in-more-suicides.html).\n\nThere was a recent study on increased suicide rates in Japan, specifically of women.\n\nI think it\'s also worth keeping in perspective that there are normally around 50,000 suicide deaths per year in the US, compared to around 500,000 deaths from COVID in the past year.', ""The region they're discussing includes Grand Rapids, the second most populous city in the state; they just aren't big on post-Renaissance science.\n\nI'm surprised to see Wayne/Oakland/Macomb counties with the highest acceptance rate.

We aren't dealing with tissue that would be otherwise destroyed.  The cells involved in the vaccines derive from a cell line that originated with a fetus that was aborted in the 70s.

If the pain aspect of needles bothers you, icing the spot or giving it a pinch right before are great ideas. You could also purchase a topical numbing cream/gel at any drugstore.\n\nFor me, it’s not about the pain, but about the needle being in my body. To combat this, I like to chat as casually as possible with the nurse about literally anything else... in this case she saw my 21st birthday was coming up, so I asked her if she had any recommendations for places that serve good drinks in our area. Anything will do, I just find that those conversations distract me from thinking about the needle for a few minutes before I get it.

We had them and everyone near them wear an amount of PPE that was generally between gloves and a mask and hazmat level shit. They were skeptical about the work we could pull off but low and behold, kid saw immediate improvement and went on to recover. They were very pleased and listened to what we had to say from like 8 different people working in the ER. They seemed very receptive and I heard through the grapevine there that they got their whole family vaccinated in a different wing of the same hospital not long after \n\nMore recently, friend of a friend was skeptical about the covid vaccine for him and his mother....Mother is on her 80s and somehow runs an in person dance studio... said he was scared she would die from the vaccine and I explained to him 2 million people have died from covid and more Americans have died from covid than wwii.

"['#Abstract\n**Background:** On 8th December 2020, deployment of the first vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 authorised for UK use, the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2, began, followed by the adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1nCoV-19 on 4th January 2021. Initially care home-residents and staff, frontline healthcare workers and adults from age 80 were targeted. In phase 3 trials, BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 demonstrated 95% and 70% efficacy, respectively, after two doses against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in elderly frail people. Evaluation following implementation to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing hospitalisations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly adults is urgent.\n\n**Methods:** A prospective single-centre test-negative design case-control study of adults aged ≥80 years hospitalised with COVID-19 disease or other acute respiratory disease. We conducted logistic regression controlling for time (week), gender, index of multiple deprivations (IMD), and care residency status (CRS), and sensitivity analyses matched for time and gender using a conditional logistic model adjusting for IMD and CRS.\n\n**Findings:** First dose vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 was 71.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.5-90.6). ChAdOx1nCoV-19 first dose vaccine effectiveness was 80.4% (95% CI 36.4-94.5). When effectiveness analysis for BNT162b2 was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1nCoV-19, the estimate was 79.3% (95% CI 47.0-92.5).\n\n**Interpretation:** A single dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine resulted in substantial reductions in the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in elderly, frail patients with extensive co-morbid disease.', '#Abstract\n\n**Background**\n\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) variants threatens progress toward control of the Covid-19 pandemic. Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use.\n\n**Methods**\n\nIn this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 micrograms recombinant spike protein with 50 micrograms Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy greater than or equal to 7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants.\n\n**Results**\n\nA total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV negative; 6% PLWH), there were 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in NVX CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1), and did not differ by baseline serostatus. Of the primary endpoint cases with available whole genome sequencing, 38 (92.7%) of 41 were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: -0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Among placebo recipients, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was similar in baseline seronegative vs baseline seropositive participants during the first 2 months of follow-up (5.3% vs 5.2%). Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThe NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant, while evidence of prior infection with the presumptive original SARS CoV-2 did not confer protection against probable B.1.351 disease.\n\n---\n\nThis is the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine.', '#Abstract\n\n**Importance:** The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected over a hundred million people worldwide, with almost 2.5 million deaths at the date of this publication. In the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were first administered to the public starting in December 2020, and no lactating women were included in the initial trials of safety/efficacy. Research on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lactating women and the potential transmission of passive immunity to the infant through breast milk is needed to guide patients, clinicians and policy makers during the worldwide effort to curb the spread of this virus.\n\n**Objective:** To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobins are found in breast milk post-vaccination, and to characterize the time course and types of immunoglobulins present. \n\n**Design:** Prospective cohort study\n\n**Setting:** Providence Portland Medical Center, Oregon, USA\n\n**Participants:** Six lactating women who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine between December 2020 and January 2021. Breast milk samples were collected pre-vaccination and at 11 additional timepoints, with last sample at 14 days post 2nd dose of vaccine.\n\n**Exposure:** Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\n**Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s):** Levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG immunoglobulins in breast milk.\n\n**Results:** In this cohort of 6 lactating women who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we observed significantly elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in breast milk beginning at Day 7 after the initial vaccine dose, with an IgG-dominant response.\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance:** We are the first to show that maternal vaccination results in SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins in breast milk that may be protective for infants.', '#Abstract\n\n**Background**\n\nViral and immune kinetics in mild to moderate COVID-19 are understudied because of challenges inherent in longitudinal sampling of people who are infectious to others, feeling ill, yet are not hospitalized. In particular, sustained molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT) in mild to moderate COVID-19 is common and confounds surveillance efforts in the community. We sought to identify host and immune determinants of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via longitudinal viral RNA, virus culture, and plasma and oral fluid antibody sampling in a prospective observational cohort study of adult outpatients with COVID-19. \n\n**Methods and Findings**\n\nSamples from 95 non-hospitalized participants ≥ 30 years old with recent COVID-19 diagnosis and known symptom onset date were analyzed. Participants self-collected mid-turbinate nasal, oropharyngeal (OP), and gingival crevicular fluid (oral fluid) samples at home and in a research clinic a median of 6 times over 1-3 months. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on 507 URT samples revealed a median time to viral RNA clearance of the URT of 33.5 days. Sixteen nasal-OP samples collected 2-11 days post-symptom onset were virus culture positive out of 183 RT-PCR positive samples tested. All participants but one with positive virus culture were negative for concomitant oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies. The kinetics of oral fluid anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. The mean time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 8-13 days post-symptom onset. Associations of symptoms, host demographics, comorbidities, and immune kinetics with time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. A longer time to first detection of oral fluid anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies was independently associated with a longer time to SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.020). BMI ≥ 25kg/m2 was also independently associated with a longer time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.78, p=0.009). Fever reported as one of first three COVID-19 symptoms was associated with shorter time to viral RNA clearance (aHR 2.06, 95% CI 1.02-4.18, p=0.044). Plasma titers of neutralizing antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies, and S-receptor binding domain (S-RBD) antibodies were obtained at 1-4 months post-symptom onset. BMI was positively correlated with post-acute plasma SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titer and anti-S-RBD antibody titer.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIn an intensively sampled cohort of 95 adult outpatients with COVID-19, we demonstrate that longer time to first detection of oral fluid SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever are independently associated with longer time to viral RNA clearance. This work provides insights into the host and immune factors most important for viral clearance in mild to moderate COVID-19.', '#Abstract\n\n**Objectives** To estimate the real-world effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine and Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine against confirmed COVID-19, hospitalisations and deaths. To estimate effectiveness on the UK variant of concern.\n\n**Design** Test negative case control design \n\n**Setting** Community COVID-19 PCR testing in England\n\n**Participants** All adults in England aged 70 years and older (over 7.5 million). All COVID-19 testing in the community among eligible individuals who reported symptoms between 8th December 2020 and 19th February 2021 was included in the analysis.\n\n**Interventions** One and two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. One dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine.\n\n**Main outcome measures** Symptomatic PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisations and deaths with COVID-19. \n\n**Results** Individuals aged &gt;=80 years vaccinated with BNT162b2 prior to 4th January, had a higher odds of testing positive in the first 9 days after vaccination (odds ratio up to 1.48, 95%CI 1.23-1.77), indicating that those initially targeted had a higher underlying risk of infection. Vaccine effectiveness was therefore estimated relative to the baseline post-vaccination period. Vaccine effects were noted from 10-13 days after vaccination, reaching an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 59-78%) from 28-34 days, then plateauing. From 14 days after the second dose a vaccine effectiveness of 89% (95%CI: 85-93%) was seen. Individuals aged &gt;=70 years vaccinated from 4th January had a similar underlying risk of COVID-19 to unvaccinated individuals. With BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness reached 61% (95%CI 51-69%) from 28-34 days after vaccination then plateaued. With the ChAdOx1 vaccine, vaccine effects were seen from 14-20 days after vaccination reaching an effectiveness of 60% (95%CI 41-73%) from 28-34 days and further increasing to 73% (95%CI 27-90%) from day 35 onwards. On top of the protection against symptomatic disease, cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of BNT162b2 had an additional 43% (95%CI 33-52%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation and an additional 51% (95%CI 37-62%) lower risk of death. Cases who had been vaccinated with one dose of ChAdOx1 had an additional 37% (95% CI 3-59%) lower risk of emergency hospitalisation. There was insufficient follow-up to assess the effect of ChAdOx1 on mortality due to the later rollout of this vaccine. Combined with the effect against symptomatic disease, this indicates that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing hospitalisation and a single dose of BNT162b2 is 85% effective at preventing death with COVID-19.\n\n**Conclusion** Vaccination with either a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic SARS-CoV2 positive cases in older adults with even greater protection against severe disease. Both vaccines show similar effects. Protection was maintained for the duration of follow-up (&gt;6 weeks). A second dose of BNT162b2 provides further protection against symptomatic disease but second doses of ChAdOx1 have not yet been rolled out in England. There is a clear effect of the vaccines against the UK variant of concern.']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[8.0, 9.0, 54.0, 2.0, 16.0]","['2021-03-03 16:17:31', '2021-03-03 16:14:07', '2021-03-02 17:43:29', '2021-03-03 15:59:06', '2021-03-02 22:51:06']",t2_blqmw,89.0,"['COVID19', 'COVID19', 'COVID19', 'COVID19']","['Preliminary Efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 Covid-19 Vaccine Against the B.1.351 Variant', 'SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected in human breast milk post-vaccination', 'Delayed rise of oral fluid antibodies, elevated BMI, and absence of early fever correlate with longer time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in an longitudinally sampled cohort of COVID-19 outpatients', 'Early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccine on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and mortality in older adults in England']","[20, 679, 9, 66]","[0, 0, 0, 0]","[12, 44, 2, 4]","[316847, 316847, 316847, 316847]","['2021-03-03 08:12:39', '2021-03-02 09:42:39', '2021-03-03 07:58:42', '2021-03-02 14:47:36']",774.0

Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19-related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g., healthcare, office work). In-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, but this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.']",[0.0],[7.0],['2021-03-03 04:15:59'],t2_e2nf0,7.0,['COVID19'],['Household COVID-19 risk and in-person schooling'],[20],[0],[9],[316847],['2021-03-02 20:08:05'],20.0

The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike pro- teins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multi- ple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human an- giotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combina- tion thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.\n\nIMPORTANCE \n\nA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.']","[0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0]","['2021-03-02 22:33:58', '2021-03-02 22:34:41']",t2_fzsa6,2.0,['COVID19'],['Introduction of Two Prolines and Removal of the Polybasic Cleavage Site Lead to Higher Efficacy of a Recombinant Spike-Based SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in the Mouse Model'],[12],[0],[3],[316847],['2021-03-02 14:32:42'],12.0

The whole virion inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate demonstrated an interim vaccine efficacy of 81% in its Phase 3 clinical trial. The trials involved 25,800 subjects, the largest ever conducted in India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research.\n\n&gt;“Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today’s results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants.\n\n&gt;COVAXIN® demonstrates high clinical efficacy trend against COVID 19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” said Dr. Krishna Ella, Chairman &amp; Managing Director, Bharat Biotech.\n\n...\n\n&gt;The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second study vaccination in serologically negative (to SARS-CoV-2) adult participants at baseline.\n\n&gt;**The first interim analysis is based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 7 cases observed in the BBV152 (COVAXIN®) group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6%.**\n\n&gt;The interim analysis included a preliminary review of the safety database, which showed that severe, serious, and medically attended adverse events occurred at low levels and were balanced between vaccine and placebo groups. The trial's conduct and monitoring are as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines and have been outsourced to IQVIA.\n\n&gt;Analysis from the National Institute of Virology indicates that vaccine-induced antibodies can\nneutralize the UK variant strains and other heterologous strains, which has been published in bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.426986\n\n&gt;Bharat Biotech expects to share further details of the trial results as additional data become available.

If you are in a very bad health position, it can be a good idea to vaccinate yourself, but if you are in a respectable enough range for the virus not to cause severely negative effects on you, the vaccine is not necessary, since it doesn't protect you 100%, the only thing you will get is a bunch of weird side effects.

It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.', ""Early reports suggested the Moderna vaccine didn't stimulate much of a CD8+ T cell response (unlike PFizers).

"['Abstract\n\nOne third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients’ CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens—including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.', 'Abstract\n\nCOVID-19 manifests with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are characterized by exaggerated and misdirected host immune responses1–8. While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the “exoproteome”). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.\n\nHumoral immunity plays dichotomous roles in COVID-19. Although neutralizing antibodies afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection9,10, growing evidence suggests that dysregulated humoral immunity also contributes to the characteristic immunopathology of COVID-1911–17. For example, subsets of COVID-19 patients commonly exhibit an expansion of pathological extrafollicular B cell populations (IgD- /CD27- double negative, DN) that have been associated with autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients12,18. Furthermore, recent reports have identified isolated autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 patients, including those that are characteristic of systemic autoimmune diseases such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor (anti-IgG-Fc antibodies), antiphospholipid antibodies, and antibodies against type 1 interferons (IFN-I)15–17. Importantly, some autoantibodies, particularly neutralizing antibodies against IFN-I, appear to directly contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology by antagonizing innate antiviral responses11. While striking examples of disease-modifying autoantibody responses have been described, the full breadth of autoantibody reactivities in COVID-19 and their immunological and clinical impacts remain undetermined at a proteome-scale. We therefore sought to identify functional autoantibody responses in COVID-19 patients by screening for autoantibody reactivities against the human exoproteome (the set of extracellular and secreted proteins in the proteome).']","[0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 2.0]","['2021-03-02 22:12:05', '2021-03-02 22:15:29']",t2_yp2ev,3.0,"['COVID19', 'COVID19']","['Exploratory neuroimmune profiling identifies CNS-specific alterations in COVID-19 patients with neurological involvement', 'Diverse Functional Autoantibodies in Patients with COVID-19']","[19, 11]","[0, 0]","[4, 2]","[316847, 316847]","['2021-03-02 14:11:25', '2021-03-02 14:09:05']",30.0

According to the vaccine tab on [the DOH Covid Dashboard](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard), as of Feb 27th, we’ve delivered ~1,080,000 first doses. Now, [here on page 46](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/820-112-InterimVaccineAllocationPrioritization.pdf) we were given a table of how many people are estimated to be eligible in each phase (and this estimate should be what they’re using to determine that 50% number), and we can see here that 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 combine to be ~2,300,000 people eligible right now, making the point where we move on at 1,115,000 first doses, which means we only need ~70,000 more from where we were on Feb 27th. Now the most recent update we’ve gotten on first/second dose split was [here](https://twitter.com/wadepthealth/status/1364641773667155971?s=21), putting us at around 22,000 first doses a day, which puts us on pace to hit that 50% number by March 3rd. Now keep in mind, this is even without the J&amp;J vaccine\n\nNow, I imagine there’s some worry at the DOH about how willing people are to take the J&amp;J vaccine given its lower published efficacy since this seems to be a major public health push everywhere, so given that we’re already about to hit a point where we were initially looking to move on to 1B2 and we’re already about to get ~60,000 J&amp;J doses, they may feel some pressure to open 1B2 to avoid a bottleneck in demand. \n\nNow one more thing, if you noticed from the table presenting how big each phase is, you’ll see that 1B2 is only ~95,000 people and we’re looking to be able to do ~82,000 first doses this week once J&amp;J is factored in (I know J&amp;J is only one dose, but for my purposes here it makes sense to consider it a first dose), and given that we’re definitely not going to get 100% uptake among those eligible in 1B2, it looks like we’re about to zoom through 1B2 very fast, so fast that I could see them doing something like opening up 1B2 and 1B3 simultaneously and just reserve a certain amount of the doses for 1B2 only (like how they pivoted to make all the mass vaccination sites only 2nd doses recently for about a week to catch us up on 2nd doses), I could see them open up to 1B2 for mass vaccination sites and open up to 1B3 for everywhere else. This last bit is only speculation but I imagine we won’t spend much time in 1B2 before moving on to 1B3 since our rate of vaccination is very fast compared to the amount of 1B2 people, less than a week’s worth\n\n**TLDR: Very soon, I would say next week at the latest for 1B2 and 1B3 should follow very shortly, if not at the same time**', 'Good news! I wish they had a better estimate of the throughput than “thousands”, but any extra sites will be especially useful as J&amp;J starts delivering and as Moderna and Pfizer ramp up production']","[0.0, 0.0]","[39.0, 12.0]","['2021-03-02 11:00:49', '2021-03-01 20:23:51']",t2_z2q3g,51.0,,,,,,,,
